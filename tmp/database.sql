Pain is the most common symptom. However, nerve compression and inflammation can cause other symptoms including numbness, tingling and/or weakness in the extremities.</p>\r\n  <p>Disc herniation can cause other symptoms, including reflex dysfunction or an abnormal reflex response in the arms or legs, depending on where in the vertebral column the disc rupture occurs. </p>\r\n  <div class=\"clear\">\r\n\r\n    <ul>\r\n      <li><span>Cervical Spine:</span> If a disc ruptures in the upper spine area, neck pain main result which radiates into the shoulders or arms.</li>\r\n      <li><span>Thoracic Spine:</span> Mid-spine disc herniation is uncommon. If a disc does rupture in this area, pain may radiate into the front or back of the body’s trunk</li>\r\n      <li><span>Lumbar Spine:</span> Disc herniation in the lower spine typically causes pain that may radiate or shoot into the buttocks, thighs, and legs. This is sometimes called sciatica.<img alt=\"Image drawing of a herniated disc, as well as bulging and normal disc\" src=\"/uploads/images/pages/1/large_disc_hernia.jpg\"></li>\r\n    </ul>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n  <div class=\"heading-block\">\r\n    <h2>Prevalence</h2>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <p>Pain in the lower back can develop for many different reasons. People use the terms \"slipped disc\" and \"ruptured disc\" very frequently and it\'s often assumed that every person who has pain in their back has a ruptured or herniated disc. The truth is, a true herniated nucleus pulposus, which is the medical term for a ruptured disc, is not a very common medical problem. In fact, most disorders that cause back pain are due to something other than a herniated disc.</p>\r\n  <p>\r\n    In general practice clinics, the overall incidence of true herniated nucleus pulposus in patients who seek medical care due to new symptoms of lower back pain is less than 2%.<p><img alt=\"Image drawing of a herniated disc in the lumbar spine\" src=\"/uploads/images/pages/1/large_disk_hernia_symptoms_01.jpg\" style=\"\"></p>\r\n  </p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n  <div class=\"heading-block\">\r\n    <h2>Reasons</h2>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"clear\">\r\n    <h3>Anatomy</h3>\r\n\r\n    <p>To better understand what happens when a disc ruptures or herniates, it\'s helpful to know a little about the anatomy of the vertebrae themselves and the different parts of the body that make up the spinal column.</p>\r\n    <p>In between each of your vertebrae is a cushion that acts like a shock-absorber. These are called intervertebral discs. They are sometimes compared to jelly doughnuts. Each disc has a tough outer ring made up of fibers, that are really a strong ligament that bind the vertebra together. This outer rim is called the annulus, and it is the strongest part of the disc. The center of each disc, called the nucleus pulposus, is filled with a gel-like substance. This soft center is what gives the discs their ability to act as shock-absorbers.</p>\r\n    <p>When a disc herniates, the tough outer rim is damaged and the soft gel center moves out of its normal space. If the rim is damaged near the spinal canal, the gel material can bulge out and press into the spinal nerves or the spinal cord.</p>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <h3>Causes of Herniated Discs</h3>\r\n  <p>The primary reasons discs herniate is due to normal wear and tear on the spine and the process of aging. As we grow older, the discs between our vertebrae are negatively affected by changes that cause them to dry out and lose some of their elasticity. This is usually a slow process and the herniation develops gradually. Occasionally, events  occur that cause a disc to suddenly rupture or herniate. Examples of these types of events are trauma, such as falls or other injuries such as car accidents. Lifting or twisting are other examples of events that can cause a disc to herniate suddenly.</p>\r\n\r\n  <p>Most cases of true herniated nucleus pulposus occur in middle-aged and young adults. Children can develop herniated discs, but this occurs rarely. In the elderly, degenerative changes in the spine that normally occur with age make it less likely for a true herniated disc to develop.</p>\r\n  <p>If too much pressure is placed suddenly on a disc, rupture can occur. One example of this can be falling from a tree and landing on the buttocks. This type of fall causes a significant amount of force to be placed on the spine all at once. If enough force is experienced, either a vertebra can break or fracture, or a disc can rupture. Bending from the waist also places extreme force on the intervertebral discs. If you try to lift a heavy object while bending, the combination of these forces can cause a ruptured disc.</p>\r\n\r\n  <p>A small amount of force can also cause a ruptured disc. When this occurs, it is usually due to weakening in the fibrous rim of the disc (the annulus) from repeated trauma that has added up over time. As the annulus becomes weaker, eventually too much force or pressure is applied and it herniates due to its weakened condition. You may be lifting or bending in a way that has never caused a problem before, but due to the aging process of the spine, a rupture occurs.</p>\r\n  <p>Herniated discs cause problems for two reasons. First, the gel-like substance that leaks into the spinal canal from the nucleus pulposus can exert pressure on the spinal nerves. There is also a possibility that this gel-like material causes a chemical irritation of the nerve roots. The pressure, combined with the irritation, can cause the nerve roots to not function correctly. The result is pain, and/or numbness and weakness in the portion of the body served by the affected nerve.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div id=\"symptoms\">\r\n  <div class=\"heading-block\">\r\n    <h2>Symptoms</h2>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <p>Some people with a true herniated disc do not experience any pain. The symptoms of the problem come from the pressure that is placed on the spinal nerves and from irritation. Many people who have disc herniation do have pain due to other problems with their back that were present when the disc ruptured. Typical symptoms of a herniated lumbar disc include:</p>\r\n  <ul>\r\n    <li>Pain that radiates into one leg or into both legs</li>\r\n    <li>Tingling or numbness in areas of one leg or both legs</li>\r\n    <li>Weakness in certain muscles of one leg or both legs</li>\r\n    <li>Absence of reflexes in one leg or both legs</li>\r\n  </ul>\r\n  <p>The location of these symptoms varies depending on which nerve or nerves have been compressed in the spinal column. The location of the symptoms will help your physician determine the correct diagnosis. By knowing where you are experiencing pain, your doctor will have a better idea of the location of the ruptured disc.  </p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div id=\"diagnostic\">\r\n  <div class=\"heading-block\">\r\n    <h2>Diagnostic procedures</h2>\r\n  </div>\r\n\r\n  <p>If your physician suspects a herniated disc, he will obtain your medical history and complete a thorough physical examination as well as neurological tests. He will observe your spine while you are standing and while walking and may ask you to complete other movements to assess your mobility and balance. He will examine your spine for any sign of abnormality and will check your reflexes, assess sensation and look for any sign of weakness. He will ask about your pain and other symptoms.</p>\r\n  <p>Your physician may recommend imaging tests to help confirm the diagnosis of a herniated disc. He may order tests such as X-rays, an MRI or a CT scan.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div id=\"treatment\">\r\n  <div class=\"heading-block\">\r\n    <h2>Treatment</h2>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"clear\">\r\n    <p>Not every case of a disc herniation requires surgery. In fact, in most cases herniated discs do not require surgical treatment. How a herniated disc is treated depends on the symptoms and whether they are resolving or getting more serious. Your doctor is more likely to recommend surgery if your symptoms are steadily becoming more severe. If your condition is improving, he may recommend a course of treatment that involves watching and waiting to see if your symptoms resolve. Many patients who experience problems because of a herniated disc when it first occurs, find their symptoms completely go away over a period of several weeks or a few months. </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"clear\">\r\n    <h3>Conservative Treatment</h3>\r\n    <p>If there are no signs of serious complications resulting from a disc that has herniated, many times doctors will recommend conservative treatment of your symptoms. Conservative treatment includes:</p>\r\n    <p>Observation: This involves watching your condition to make sure the herniation does not lead to other serious complications. If there are no indications of progressive weakness or numbness, and your pain is manageable, your physician may suggest watching and waiting.</p>\r\n    <p>Rest: If the herniated disc causes more significant pain, your activity may need to be decreased, and you may need a few days away from your job. After resting for several days, slowly start to increase your activity with gentle tasks such as walking, and gradually increase your activity tolerance.</p>\r\n    <p>Pain medications: Depending on how severe your pain is, different analgesics (pain medications) can be used to help you be more comfortable. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like aspirin, ibuprofen and naproxen can be purchased over-the-counter and help to relieve pain and decrease the inflammation caused by the disc herniation. These drugs can cause stomach irritation, so should be taken with food.  If these medications are not effective, your physician may prescribe stronger medication for your pain such as narcotics, muscle relaxants or other types of medications. Narcotic analgesics can become addictive, and many doctors will not prescribe these for more than a few weeks.</p>\r\n    <p>Epidural Steroid Injection (ESI): An injection of a steroid medication such as prednisone directly into the affected disc area to decrease the pain and inflammation is usually only suggested in cases of severe pain or if surgery is quickly becoming the only other available treatment option. ESI is only effective as a pain control intervention about 50% of the time.</p>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <h3>Surgical Treatment</h3>\r\n  <div class=\"clear\">\r\n    <h4>Laminotomy and Discectomy</h4>\r\n    <p>The most traditional surgical procedure for treating a herniated disc is the laminotomy and discectomy.</p>\r\n    <p>In this operation, an incision is made in the back directly over the disc that has herniated. The muscle tissues under the skin are moved so the doctor can see the backbones. It may be necessary to take X-rays during the operation to make sure the correct vertebra and disc are chosen. A small incision is made in between the two vertebrae where the ruptured disc is located. This incision allows the surgeon to visualize the spinal canal. A small portion of the vertebra (the lamina) usually needs to be removed to make access to the spinal canal possible.</p>\r\n    <p>The surgeon then finds the gel-like disc material which has ruptured from the disc and removes it from the spinal canal. This will take the pressure and irritation off the spine. He also removes as much of the material he can that is still inside the disc to prevent it from leaking out (herniating) again.</p>\r\n    <p>When the doctor is finished with the procedure, the muscles are replaced into position, and the skin incision is closed with metal staples or sutures.</p>\r\n\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"clear\">\r\n    <h4>Micro-discectomy</h4>\r\n    <p>This procedure is basically the same as the traditional laminotomy and discectomy; however, the incision is much smaller. This means there is less injury to the unaffected parts of your spine during the procedure and recovery may occur more rapidly.</p>\r\n    <p>A very small incision is made just over the herniated disc, and the muscles are moved aside as in the traditional procedure. Once the vertebra is seen, an operating microscope is inserted and used to complete the operation. The remainder of the procedure is completed using the same approach as the traditional method.</p>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"clear\">\r\n    <h4>Endoscopic Discectomy</h4>\r\n    <p>In this operation, even smaller incisions are needed to insert special television cameras into the spinal canal so the surgeon can visualize the disc material. Other special surgical instruments are also inserted through these small incisions, and the surgeon views the TV screen and guides the instruments to remove the disc material.</p>\r\n    <p>This procedure is not yet being widely used and is still evolving. It is beneficial in that the incisions required are very small (1/4 inch), so do even less damage to tissues around the spine than the micro-discectomy. This can mean fewer complications and faster recovery times.</p>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"clear\">\r\n    <h3>Complications</h3>\r\n    <h4>Before surgery</h4>\r\n    <p>Complications from a herniated disc can occur even before surgery. Cauda equina syndrome  is probably the most serious complication that can occur as a result of a herniated disc. This syndrome results when a large portion of disc material ruptures into the spinal canal in the area where the nerves travel which control bowel and bladder function.  Permanent damage to these nerves can result from pressure. If this happens, you may become incontinent (lose control) of bowel and bladder function. This is a rare, but serious condition. If your physician suspects this is happening, he will recommend immediate surgery to get the pressure off the nerves.  </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"clear\">\r\n    <h4>During surgery</h4>\r\n    <p>During any type of surgical procedure there is always the risk of complication due to anesthesia. Possible complications during an operation for a herniated disc include:</p>\r\n    <p>Nerve injury: Removal of herniated disc material involves working near the spinal nerves. During the procedure, the nerves may be damaged or injured. If this happens, you may suffer nerve damage, causing permanent weakness, numbness or pain in the area the nerve travels.</p>\r\n    <p>Dural Tear: The spinal cord and the spinal nerves are covered with a water-tight bag of tissue which is called the dura mater. During surgery, a tear can occur in this covering and it is not unusual for this to occur in any type of operation on the spine.  If the tear is noticed during the operation, it is repaired and usually heals without further complication. If it goes unnoticed during surgery, the tear may not heal and it can leak spinal fluid. Leakage of spinal fluid can result in problems such as spinal headaches and the risk of infection in the spinal fluid, called spinal meningitis. If the leak does not heal and seal itself on its own fairly soon after surgery, the tear in the dura may have to be surgically repaired. This would require a second operation.</p>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"clear\">\r\n    <h4>After surgery</h4>\r\n    <p>Some complications do not become apparent until after surgery. Some become evident soon after your operation and others may take months to show up. Post-surgical complications include:</p>\r\n    <p><span>Infection:</span>  All surgical procedures carry some risk for infection and surgery on the spine is no different. Infection can develop around the nerves in the spinal canal, inside the affected disc or in the incision made in the skin.  If infection involves only the incision in your skin, the only treatment needed may be antibiotics. If the infection develops in the disc area or in the spinal canal, you may need further surgery to drain the infection in addition to antibiotics.</p>\r\n    <p><span>Re-herniation:</span> There is about a 10-15% chance that the same disc that was operated on will herniate again. This usually occurs within the first six weeks following your surgery, but it may happen anytime. If this occurs, you may need another operation.</p>\r\n    <p><span>Persistent pain:</span> Surgery does not always eliminate pain. There are many reasons people continue to have pain despite back surgery. These reasons include:</p>\r\n    <ul>\r\n      <li>If the nerves have been damaged by pressure caused from the herniated disc, complete recovery may not be possible.</li>\r\n      <li>Scar tissue may form around the nerves following surgery. This puts pressure on the nerves and causes pain similar to the pain caused by the herniated disc.</li>\r\n      <li>The pain you were having prior to surgery may be from issues in addition to disc herniation that were not solved by removing the herniated disc.</li>\r\n    </ul>\r\n    <p><span>Degenerative disc Disease:</span>  Any time a disc is injured, the injury can lead to degeneration in that portion of the spine. A disc that has been surgically altered can certainly be considered as \"injured.\" This places the surrounding area of the spine at increased risk for degenerative changes to occur.  The degenerative process is very slow, usually taking several years to occur, but if the changes caused by degeneration become severe, a second surgery may be needed.</p>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"clear\">\r\n    <h3>Rehabilitation</h3>\r\n\r\n    <p>Following your operation, your physician will probably recommend physical therapy before you begin an exercise routine on your own. A skilled therapist will help you choose exercises that are safe and effective for you as an individual. Exercise is essential to your recovery as well as to maintaining your spine health over time. It\'s the easiest and most sensible way to combat problems with your back.</p>\r\n    <p>Research has shown that exercise, done on a regular basis is linked to fewer back problems. It has many benefits for your spine health including:</p>\r\n    <ul>\r\n      <li>Strengthening: It can help strengthen your core muscles that help support your spine, and also can strengthen the muscles of your arms and legs. Strength in your muscles reduces back strain.</li>\r\n      <li>Exercise can reduce your risk of falling and sustaining injuries.</li>\r\n      <li>Stretching exercises decrease the risk of painful spasms in the muscles.</li>\r\n      <li>Weight-bearing exercise helps to prevent osteoporosis, which in turn decreases your risk of compression fractures.</li>\r\n      <li>Aerobic exercise, the kind that increases your heart rate, can help to relieve pain. It stimulates the body to release its own \"feel good\" chemicals, called endorphins.</li>\r\n    </ul>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n',1),(2,2,'main_content','<div>\r\n  <div class=\"heading-block\">\r\n    <h2>Spine Anatomy &amp; Physiology</h2>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <p>\r\n    The spinal column in the human body normally is made up of 24 vertebrae that are connected by joints and nine vertebrae in the sacrum and the coccyx or tailbone that are fused together. The spine, or the vertebral column is located in the back of the trunk or the torso. In between each pair of vertebrae, other than those that are fused, lies an intervertebral disc that separates the backbones and provides cushioning and absorbs the vibrations that occur with movement. The spinal cord is located within the protective spinal column.\r\n  </p>\r\n  <p>\r\n    The vertebral column is normally consists of 33 vertebrae. This includes the 5 sacral vertebrae and the 4 bones of the coccyx (tailbone). The upper 24 vertebrae are separated into three regions, the cervical, the thoracic and the lumbar regions.\r\n  </p>\r\n\r\n  <div class=\"clear\">\r\n    <h3>Cervical</h3>\r\n\r\n    <p>The cervical region of the spine is made up of the first 7 vertebrae found closest to the skull in the neck area. They are named C1 through C7 beginning closest to the skull and continuing in order away from it.</p>\r\n  </div>\r\n\r\n  <h3>Thoracic</h3>\r\n  <p>There are 12 thoracic vertebrae found in the chest and rib area. They are named T1 through T12. T1 lies next to C7, separated by an intervertebral disc.</p>\r\n\r\n  <h3>Lumbar</h3>\r\n  <p>There are 5 lumbar vertebrae in the low back and pelvis, L1 through L5. L1 immediately follows T12 with an intervertebral disc separating the two.</p>\r\n  <p>\r\n    Occasionally an additional vertebra is found in an area of the spine, or a vertebra is missing in one region and the deficiency is made up in another area. Very rarely, however, is the number of cervical vertebrae altered.<p><img src=\"/uploads/images/pages/2/overal_spine.jpg\"></p>\r\n  </p>\r\n</div>\r\n',1),(3,3,'main_content','<div>\r\n  <div class=\"heading-block\">\r\n    <h2>Definition</h2>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <p>Your backbone (spine, vertebrae) protects your spinal cord and allows you to stand and bend. A wide range of spine diseases can occur, for many different reasons. Some of these include: </p>\r\n  <div class=\"clear\">\r\n\r\n    <ul>\r\n      <li>Infections</li>\r\n      <li>Injuries</li>\r\n      <li>Tumors</li>\r\n      <li>Conditions, such as scoliosis and ankylosing spondylitis</li>\r\n      <li>Bone changes that come with aging, such as herniated discs and spinal stenosis</li>\r\n    </ul>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <p>\r\n    Spine diseases may be accompanied by very different symptoms, and many times these conditions also cause pain. Pain is most likely to happen when pressure or stress is placed on the spinal cord or nerves. These spine diseases can also limit movement. Treatments vary, depending on condition or disease, but sometimes include braces, splints or surgery.<p><img src=\"/uploads/images/pages/3/large_dollarphotoclub_29565408.jpg\" style=\"\"></p>\r\n  </p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n  <div class=\"heading-block\">\r\n    <h2>Reasons</h2>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"clear\">\r\n    <ul>\r\n      <li>Spine diseases can be caused by damage to the spinal cord due to infection, injury or lack of blood supply</li>\r\n      <li>In many spine diseases, the muscles are weakened or even paralyzed, sensation is decreased, lost or abnormal. Bowel and bladder function can be affected</li>\r\n      <li>Diagnosis of spine diseases is based on symptoms, a physical exam and the results of tests, such as an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging)</li>\r\n      <li>The underlying reason for the spine disease is corrected, if possible</li>\r\n      <li>Rehab, such as physical therapy, is often needed to regain strength, function and mobility</li>\r\n    </ul>\r\n  </div>\r\n\r\n  <p>Spine diseases may involve the spinal cord. It is the main path of communication between the body and the brain. The spinal cord is long cord that starts at the base of the brain and extends down. The vertebrae, or back bones, are involved in many spine diseases. They provide protection for the spinal cord. Discs between the vertebrae cushion the spine. They are made of cartilage and they can also be affected by spine diseases.</p>\r\n  <p>\r\n    Spine diseases can affect any section of the spine, the cervical (neck), the middle or chest (thoracic), the lower back (lumbar) or the pelvic region (sacral). In medical terminology, each of these sections are referred to by their first letter: C, T, L and S.\r\n  </p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div id=\"symptoms\">\r\n  <div class=\"heading-block\">\r\n    <h2>Causes of Spine Diseases</h2>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <p>Some spine diseases start outside the spinal canal. These include things like many types of infections and injuries. Compression also often originates outside the canal and results in spine disease. Pressure on the spinal cord or nerves can be caused by bone, blood accumulation, an abscess, a mass or tumor, or a herniated disc.  </p>\r\n\r\n  <p>Less often, spine diseases start in the spinal canal itself. These include some types of infection, multiple sclerosis, blockages in the blood flow, inflammation, tumors, bleeding and vitamin and mineral deficiencies. </p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div id=\"diagnostic\">\r\n  <div class=\"heading-block\">\r\n    <h2>Symptoms</h2>\r\n  </div>\r\n\r\n  <p>Spine diseases cause a variety of different symptoms depending on which part of the spine is affected. The following symptoms may be noted, and their severity can range from mild to severe:</p>\r\n\r\n  <div class=\"clear\">\r\n    <ul>\r\n      <li>Pain</li>\r\n      <li>Muscle weakness</li>\r\n      <li>Loss or change in sensation</li>\r\n      <li>Paralysis</li>\r\n      <li>Loss of bowel and/or bladder control (incontinence)</li>\r\n      <li>Sexual dysfunction</li>\r\n      <li>Changes in reflexes</li>\r\n    </ul>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <p>\r\n    Physicians can determine what part of the spinal cord or nerves are affected by a spine disease by identifying the functions that are affected or lost. The ability to perform certain functions may be partially or totally lost. Only those function that are controlled by areas of the spinal cord below the damage are affected; those above are left intact.\r\n  </p>\r\n  <p>\r\n    In spine diseases that cause paralysis or weakness, muscles that are not used often become flaccid or limp. In other conditions, especially in some spine diseases that are inherited and in some injuries involving the spinal cord, paralysis occurs with muscle spasms. This is known as spastic paralysis. Muscle spasms occur in these spine diseases because the brain cannot help control certain reflexes.\r\n  </p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div id=\"treatment\">\r\n  <div class=\"heading-block\">\r\n    <h2>Diagnostic procedures</h2>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <p>\r\n    Doctors often recognize a spine disease by its characteristic symptoms. Patients are given a physical examination which helps to determine a diagnosis and can provide the doctor with information to determine where any damage is located. Often imaging testing is recommended to help determine the cause of a spine disease.\r\n  </p>\r\n  <p>\r\n    Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is one of the most accurate tests available for diagnosing spine diseases. This test provides images of the spinal cord and the soft tissues surrounding it, such as herniated discs, infections, tumors and other structures. If an MRI is not available, the doctor may suggest computed tomography (CT) with myelography to diagnose spine diseases. This is a test in which a dye is injected into the area around the spinal cord, and then a CT scan is completed to provide detailed images for the doctor to review.\r\n  </p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div id=\"treatment\">\r\n  <div class=\"heading-block\">\r\n    <h2>Treatment</h2>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <p>\r\n    If symptoms of a spine disease suddenly appear, such as sudden weakness or loss of feeling, you should see your doctor right away. Immediate treatment might help prevent permanent nerve damage.\r\n  </p>\r\n  <p>\r\n    Patients who are paralyzed due to a spine disease may need skilled care to prevent complications. Complications of prolonged bed rest may include:\r\n  </p>\r\n  <div class=\"clear\">\r\n    <ul>\r\n      <li><span>Pressure ulcers:</span> To prevent this complication of spine diseases, the skin is checked often, kept dry and clean, and the patient is repositioned often. Sometimes special equipment is used to keep pressure off the bony parts of the body, such as the heels, elbows, hips and tailbone.</li>\r\n      <li><span>Urinary complications:</span> If a patient cannot use a commode or toilet, a catheter may be inserted to prevent urinary complications of spine diseases. To decrease the risk of infection, catheter insertion is a sterile procedure and the catheter is carefully cared for. Hydration is very important for spine disease patients who have urinary catheters.</li>\r\n      <li><span>Pneumonia:</span> To decrease the chance of pneumonia in spine disease patients, deep breathing exercises may be used. The patient may also require suctioning of their secretions if they are unable to cough on their own.</li>\r\n      <li><span>Blood clots:</span> Patients who have spine diseases and can\'t move on their own are at risk for blood clots. To prevent this, medications like heparin may be given.</li>\r\n    </ul>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <p>\r\n    People who have spine diseases and have suffered extensive loss of independence are often depressed and discouraged. Counseling is sometimes very helpful and can help prepare patients for rehab. \r\n  </p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div id=\"treatment\">\r\n  <div class=\"heading-block\">\r\n    <h2>Rehabilitation</h2>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <p>\r\n    Rehab usually includes a team of nurses, therapists, a doctor, a dietitian, social worker, counselors and other professionals who work with a patient and their family to help them recover from their spine disease and regain as much independence as possible. Nurses will assist with learning how to manage physical care and concerns. Therapists work with the patient on physical strengthening and independence with tasks of daily living. Counselors and social workers can assist with issues spine disease patients face as they return to family life, work and the community.\r\n  </p>\r\n</div>\r\n',1),(4,4,'main_content','<div>\r\n  <div class=\"heading-block\">\r\n    <h2>Overview</h2>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <p>\r\n    In this section you\'ll find a brief overview of tests frequently ordered by physicians to help them in diagnosing conditions related to the bones, joints and spine. The goal of diagnostic testing is to help identify the nature of your condition or injury so your doctor can plan the appropriate treatment and you can receive the best possible care.<p><img alt=\"Image photo of medical diagnostic testing on a patient.\" src=\"/uploads/images/pages/4/large_dollarphotoclub_51097779.jpg\" style=\"\"></p>\r\n  </p>\r\n</div>\r\n',1),(5,5,'main_content','<div>\r\n  <div class=\"heading-block\">\r\n    <h2>Prophylaxis</h2>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <p>\r\n    The increasing numbers of people who are suffering from disorders of the spine, despite the tremendous progress that has been made in diagnosis and treatment, reveals the need to find a way to prevent these disorders and conditions. The problem is that all the activities involved with prophylaxis or prevention, such as exercise, fitness and regular medical care, should be life-long habits, but the effects are not immediately seen.\r\n  </p>\r\n  <p>\r\n    You can easily learn what you can do in your everyday life to protect your spinal health.

These are called&nbsp;<i style=\\\"box-sizing:\n  border-box;\\\">intervertebral discs.&nbsp;</i>They are sometimes compared to jelly\n  doughnuts. Each disc has a tough outer ring made up of fibers, that are really a\n  strong ligament that bind the vertebra together. This outer rim is called the&nbsp;<i\n  style=\\\"box-sizing: border-box;\\\">annulus,&nbsp;</i>and it is the strongest part\n  of the disc<i style=\\\"box-sizing: border-box;\\\">.&nbsp;</i>The center of each disc,\n  called the&nbsp;<i style=\\\"box-sizing: border-box;\\\">nucleus pulposus,&nbsp;</i>is\n  filled with a gel-like substance. This soft center is what gives the discs their\n  ability to act as shock-absorbers.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br style=\\\"box-sizing: border-box;\\\"><br\n  style=\\\"box-sizing: border-box;\\\"></p><p style=\\\"margin-bottom: 10px; font-family:\n  \'Open Sans\', sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px; box-sizing: border-box;\n  color: rgb(102, 102, 102);\\\">When a disc herniates, the tough outer rim is damaged\n  and the soft gel center moves out of its normal space. If the rim is damaged near\n  the spinal canal, the gel material can bulge out and press into the spinal nerves\n  or the spinal cord.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"margin-bottom: 10px; font-family: \'Open\n  Sans\', sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px; box-sizing: border-box; color:\n  rgb(102, 102, 102);\\\"><b style=\\\"box-sizing: border-box;\\\">Causes of&nbsp;Herniated\n  Discs</b></p><p style=\\\"margin-bottom: 10px; font-family: \'Open Sans\', sans-serif;\n  font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px; box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(102, 102,\n  102);\\\">The primary reasons discs herniate is due to normal wear and tear on the\n  spine and the process of aging. As we grow older, the discs between our vertebrae\n  are negatively affected by changes that cause them to dry out and lose some of their\n  elasticity. This is usually a slow process and the herniation develops gradually.\n  Occasionally, events &nbsp;occur that cause a disc to suddenly rupture or herniate.\n  Examples of these types of events are trauma, such as falls or other injuries such\n  as car accidents. Lifting or twisting are other examples of events that can cause\n  a disc to herniate suddenly.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"margin-bottom: 10px; font-family:\n  \'Open Sans\', sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px; box-sizing: border-box;\n  color: rgb(102, 102, 102);\\\">Most cases of true herniated nucleus pulposus occur\n  in middle-aged and young adults. Children can develop herniated discs, but this\n  occurs rarely. In the elderly, degenerative changes in the spine that normally occur\n  with age make it less likely for a true herniated disc to develop. &nbsp;</p><p\n  style=\\\"margin-bottom: 10px; font-family: \'Open Sans\', sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\n  line-height: 20px; box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(102, 102, 102);\\\">If too much\n  pressure is placed suddenly on a disc, rupture can occur. One example of this can\n  be falling from a tree and landing on the buttocks. This type of fall causes a significant\n  amount of force to be placed on the spine all at once. If enough force is experienced,\n  either a vertebra can break or fracture, or a disc can rupture. Bending from the\n  waist also places extreme force on the intervertebral discs. If you try to lift\n  a heavy object while bending, the combination of these forces can cause a ruptured\n  disc. &nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"margin-bottom: 10px; font-family: \'Open Sans\', sans-serif;\n  font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px; box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(102, 102,\n  102);\\\">A small amount of force can also cause a ruptured disc. When this occurs,\n  it is usually due to weakening in the fibrous rim of the disc (the&nbsp;<i style=\\\"box-sizing:\n  border-box;\\\">annulus)&nbsp;</i>from repeated trauma that has added up over time.\n  As the annulus becomes weaker, eventually too much force or pressure is applied\n  and it herniates due to its weakened condition. You may be lifting or bending in\n  a way that has never caused a problem before, but due to the aging process of the\n  spine, a rupture occurs.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"margin-bottom: 10px; font-family: \'Open\n  Sans\', sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px; box-sizing: border-box; color:\n  rgb(102, 102, 102);\\\"></p><p style=\\\"margin-bottom: 10px; font-family: \'Open Sans\',\n  sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px; box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(102,\n  102, 102);\\\">Herniated discs cause problems for two reasons. First, the gel-like\n  substance that leaks into the spinal canal from the nucleus pulposus can exert pressure\n  on the spinal nerves. There is also a possibility that this gel-like material causes\n  a chemical irritation of the nerve roots. The pressure, combined with the irritation,\n  can cause the nerve roots to not function correctly. The result is pain, and/or\n  numbness and weakness in the portion of the body served by the affected nerve.&nbsp;</p><div\n  class=\\\"author\\\" style=\\\"font-family: \'Open Sans\', sans-serif; font-size: 10px;\n  margin-top: -10px; margin-right: 10px; box-sizing: border-box; font-style: italic;\n  float: right; color: rgb(102, 102, 102);\\\"></div><div class=\\\"row\\\" style=\\\"margin-left:\n  -15px; font-family: \'Open Sans\', sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px;\n  margin-right: -15px; box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(102, 102, 102);\\\"></div><h2\n  style=\\\"margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 10px; font-family: \'Open Sans\', sans-serif;\n  font-weight: 500; line-height: 1.1; color: rgb(153, 0, 102); box-sizing: border-box;\\\">Symptoms</h2><p\n  style=\\\"margin-bottom: 10px; font-family: \'Open Sans\', sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\n  line-height: 20px; box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(102, 102, 102);\\\">Some people\n  with a true herniated disc do not experience any pain.

If there are no indications of progressive weakness or numbness,\n  and your pain is manageable, your physician may suggest watching and waiting.&nbsp;</p><p\n  style=\\\"margin-bottom: 10px; font-family: \'Open Sans\', sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\n  line-height: 20px; box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(102, 102, 102);\\\"><b style=\\\"box-sizing:\n  border-box;\\\">Rest:</b>&nbsp;If the herniated disc causes more significant pain,\n  your activity may need to be decreased, and you may need a few days away from your\n  job. After resting for several days, slowly start to increase your activity with\n  gentle tasks such as walking, and gradually increase your activity tolerance. &nbsp;</p><p\n  style=\\\"margin-bottom: 10px; font-family: \'Open Sans\', sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\n  line-height: 20px; box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(102, 102, 102);\\\"><b style=\\\"box-sizing:\n  border-box;\\\">Pain medications:&nbsp;</b>Depending on how severe your pain is, different&nbsp;<i\n  style=\\\"box-sizing: border-box;\\\">analgesics</i>&nbsp;(pain medications) can be\n  used to help you be more comfortable. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)\n  like aspirin, ibuprofen and naproxen can be purchased over-the-counter and help\n  to relieve pain and decrease the inflammation caused by the disc herniation. These\n  drugs can cause stomach irritation, so should be taken with food. &nbsp;If&nbsp;these\n  medications are not effective, your physician may prescribe stronger medication\n  for your pain such as narcotics, muscle relaxants or other types of medications.\n  Narcotic analgesics can become addictive, and many doctors will not prescribe these\n  for more than a few weeks.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"margin-bottom: 10px; font-family:\n  \'Open Sans\', sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px; box-sizing: border-box;\n  color: rgb(102, 102, 102);\\\"><b style=\\\"box-sizing: border-box;\\\">Epidural Steroid\n  Injection (ESI):</b>&nbsp;An injection of a steroid medication such as prednisone\n  directly into the affected disc area to decrease the pain and inflammation is usually\n  only suggested in cases of severe pain or if surgery is quickly becoming the only\n  other available treatment option. ESI is only effective as a pain control intervention\n  about 50% of the time.&nbsp;</p><h3 style=\\\"margin-top: 5px; font-family: Roboto,\n  sans-serif; font-weight: 400; line-height: 1.1; color: rgb(102, 102, 102); box-sizing:\n  border-box;\\\">Surgical Treatment</h3><h4 style=\\\"margin-bottom: 0px; font-family:\n  Roboto, sans-serif; font-weight: 300; line-height: 1.1; color: rgb(153, 0, 102);\n  font-size: 16px; box-sizing: border-box; text-transform: uppercase;\\\">LAMINOTOMY\n  AND DISCECTOMY</h4><p style=\\\"margin-bottom: 10px; font-family: \'Open Sans\', sans-serif;\n  font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px; box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(102, 102,\n  102);\\\">The most traditional surgical procedure for treating a herniated disc is\n  the laminotomy and discectomy.&nbsp;<br style=\\\"box-sizing: border-box;\\\"></p><p\n  style=\\\"margin-bottom: 10px; font-family: \'Open Sans\', sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\n  line-height: 20px; box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(102, 102, 102);\\\">In this\n  operation, an incision is made in the back directly over the disc that has herniated.\n  The muscle tissues under the skin are moved so the doctor can see the backbones.\n  It may be necessary to take X-rays during the operation to make sure the correct\n  vertebra and disc are chosen. A small incision is made in between the two vertebrae\n  where the ruptured disc is located. This incision allows the surgeon to visualize\n  the spinal canal. A small portion of the vertebra (the&nbsp;<i style=\\\"box-sizing:\n  border-box;\\\">lamina)&nbsp;</i>usually needs to be removed to make access to the\n  spinal canal possible.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"margin-bottom: 10px; font-family: \'Open\n  Sans\', sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px; box-sizing: border-box; color:\n  rgb(102, 102, 102);\\\">The surgeon then finds the gel-like disc material which has\n  ruptured from the disc and removes it from the spinal canal. This will take the\n  pressure and irritation off the spine. He also removes as much of the material he\n  can that is still inside the disc to prevent it from leaking out (herniating) again.\n  &nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"margin-bottom: 10px; font-family: \'Open Sans\', sans-serif;\n  font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px; box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(102, 102,\n  102);\\\">When the doctor is finished with the procedure, the muscles are replaced\n  into position, and the skin incision is closed with metal staples or sutures.&nbsp;</p><h4\n  style=\\\"margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-weight: 300; line-height:\n  1.1; color: rgb(153, 0, 102); font-size: 16px; box-sizing: border-box; text-transform:\n  uppercase;\\\">MICRO-DISCECTOMY</h4><p style=\\\"margin-bottom: 10px; font-family: \'Open\n  Sans\', sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px; box-sizing: border-box; color:\n  rgb(102, 102, 102);\\\">This procedure is basically the same as the traditional laminotomy\n  and discectomy; however, the incision is much smaller. This means there is less\n  injury to the unaffected parts of your spine during the procedure and recovery may\n  occur more rapidly.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"margin-bottom: 10px; font-family: \'Open\n  Sans\', sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px; box-sizing: border-box; color:\n  rgb(102, 102, 102);\\\">A very small incision is made just over the herniated disc,\n  and the muscles are moved aside as in the traditional procedure. Once the vertebra\n  is seen, an operating microscope is inserted and used to complete the operation.\n  The remainder of the procedure is completed using the same approach as the traditional\n  method.&nbsp;</p><h4 style=\\\"margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: Roboto, sans-serif;\n  font-weight: 300; line-height: 1.1; color: rgb(153, 0, 102); font-size: 16px; box-sizing:\n  border-box; text-transform: uppercase;\\\">ENDOSCOPIC DISCECTOMY</h4><p style=\\\"margin-bottom:\n  10px; font-family: \'Open Sans\', sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px;\n  box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(102, 102, 102);\\\">In this operation, even smaller\n  incisions are needed to insert special television cameras into the spinal canal\n  so the surgeon can visualize the disc material. Other special surgical instruments\n  are also inserted through these small incisions, and the surgeon views the TV screen\n  and guides the instruments to remove the disc material. &nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"margin-bottom:\n  10px; font-family: \'Open Sans\', sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px;\n  box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(102, 102, 102);\\\">This procedure is not yet being\n  widely used and is still evolving. It is beneficial in that the incisions required\n  are very small (1/4 inch), so do even less damage to tissues around the spine than\n  the micro-discectomy. This can mean fewer complications and faster recovery times.</p><h3\n  style=\\\"margin-top: 5px; font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-weight: 400; line-height:\n  1.1; color: rgb(102, 102, 102); box-sizing: border-box;\\\">Complications:</h3><h4\n  style=\\\"margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-weight: 300; line-height:\n  1.1; color: rgb(153, 0, 102); font-size: 16px; box-sizing: border-box; text-transform:\n  uppercase;\\\">BEFORE SURGERY:</h4><p style=\\\"margin-bottom: 10px; font-family: \'Open\n  Sans\', sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px; box-sizing: border-box; color:\n  rgb(102, 102, 102);\\\">Complications from a herniated disc can occur even before\n  surgery. C<i style=\\\"box-sizing: border-box;\\\">auda equina syndrome</i>&nbsp; is\n  probably the most serious complication that can occur as a result of a herniated\n  disc. This syndrome results when a large portion of disc material ruptures into\n  the spinal canal in the area where the nerves travel which control bowel and bladder\n  function. &nbsp;Permanent damage to these nerves can result from pressure. If this\n  happens, you may become incontinent (lose control) of bowel and bladder function.\n  This is a rare, but serious condition. If your physician suspects this is happening,\n  he will recommend immediate surgery to get the pressure off the nerves. &nbsp;</p><h4\n  style=\\\"margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-weight: 300; line-height:\n  1.1; color: rgb(153, 0, 102); font-size: 16px; box-sizing: border-box; text-transform:\n  uppercase;\\\">DURING SURGERY</h4><p style=\\\"margin-bottom: 10px; font-family: \'Open\n  Sans\', sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px; box-sizing: border-box; color:\n  rgb(102, 102, 102);\\\">During any type of surgical procedure there is always the\n  risk of complication due to anesthesia. Possible complications during an operation\n  for a herniated disc include:&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"margin-bottom: 10px; font-family:\n  \'Open Sans\', sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px; box-sizing: border-box;\n  color: rgb(102, 102, 102);\\\"><b style=\\\"box-sizing: border-box;\\\">Nerve injury:&nbsp;</b>Removal\n  of herniated disc material involves working near the spinal nerves. During the procedure,\n  the nerves may be damaged or injured. If this happens, you may suffer nerve damage,\n  causing permanent weakness, numbness or pain in the area the nerve travels.&nbsp;</p><p\n  style=\\\"margin-bottom: 10px; font-family: \'Open Sans\', sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\n  line-height: 20px; box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(102, 102, 102);\\\"><b style=\\\"box-sizing:\n  border-box;\\\">Dural Tear:&nbsp;</b>The spinal cord and the spinal nerves are covered\n  with a water-tight bag of tissue which is called the&nbsp;<i style=\\\"box-sizing:\n  border-box;\\\">dura mater.&nbsp;</i>During surgery, a tear can occur in this covering\n  and it is not unusual for this to occur in any type of operation on the spine. &nbsp;If\n  the tear is noticed during the operation, it is repaired and usually heals without\n  further complication. If it goes unnoticed during surgery, the tear may not heal\n  and it can leak spinal fluid. Leakage of spinal fluid can result in problems such\n  as spinal headaches and the risk of infection in the spinal fluid, called&nbsp;<i\n  style=\\\"box-sizing: border-box;\\\">spinal meningitis.&nbsp;</i>If the leak does not\n  heal and seal itself on its own fairly soon after surgery, the tear in the dura\n  may have to be surgically repaired. This would require a second operation. &nbsp;</p><h4\n  style=\\\"margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-weight: 300; line-height:\n  1.1; color: rgb(153, 0, 102); font-size: 16px; box-sizing: border-box; text-transform:\n  uppercase;\\\">AFTER SURGERY:</h4><p style=\\\"margin-bottom: 10px; font-family: \'Open\n  Sans\', sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px; box-sizing: border-box; color:\n  rgb(102, 102, 102);\\\">Some complications do&nbsp;not become apparent until after\n  surgery. Some become evident soon after your operation and others may take months\n  to show up. Post-surgical complications include:</p><p style=\\\"margin-bottom: 10px;\n  font-family: \'Open Sans\', sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px; box-sizing:\n  border-box; color: rgb(102, 102, 102);\\\"><b style=\\\"box-sizing: border-box;\\\">Infection:\n  &nbsp;</b>All surgical procedures carry some risk for infection and surgery on the\n  spine is no different. Infection can develop around the nerves in the spinal canal,\n  inside the affected disc or in the incision made in the skin. &nbsp;If infection\n  involves only the incision in your skin, the only treatment needed may be antibiotics.\n  If the infection develops in the disc area or in the spinal canal, you may need\n  further surgery to drain the infection in addition to antibiotics. &nbsp;</p><p\n  style=\\\"margin-bottom: 10px; font-family: \'Open Sans\', sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\n  line-height: 20px; box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(102, 102, 102);\\\"><b style=\\\"box-sizing:\n  border-box;\\\">Re-herniation:</b>&nbsp;There is about a 10-15% chance that the same\n  disc that was operated on will herniate again. This usually occurs within the first\n  six weeks following your surgery, but it may happen anytime. If this occurs, you\n  may need another operation.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"margin-bottom: 10px; font-family:\n  \'Open Sans\', sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px; box-sizing: border-box;\n  color: rgb(102, 102, 102);\\\"><b style=\\\"box-sizing: border-box;\\\">Persistent pain:&nbsp;</b>Surgery\n  does not always eliminate pain.

In\n  fact, most disorders that cause back pain are due to something other than a herniated\n  disc.</p><p style=\\\"margin-bottom: 10px; font-family: \'Open Sans\', sans-serif; font-size:\n  14px; line-height: 20px; box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(102, 102, 102);\\\">In\n  general practice clinics, the overall incidence of true herniated nucleus pulposus\n  in patients who seek medical care due to new symptoms of lower back pain is less\n  than 2%.<p><img src=\\\"/uploads/images/pages/1/large_disk_hernia_symptoms_01.jpg\\\"\n  style=\\\"\\\"></p><p></p></p><p style=\\\"margin-bottom: 10px; font-family: \'Open Sans\',\n  sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px; box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(102,\n  102, 102);\\\"><p></p></p><div class=\\\"author\\\" style=\\\"font-family: \'Open Sans\',\n  sans-serif; font-size: 10px; margin-top: -10px; margin-right: 10px; box-sizing:\n  border-box; font-style: italic; float: right; color: rgb(102, 102, 102);\\\"></div><div\n  class=\\\"row\\\" style=\\\"margin-left: -15px; font-family: \'Open Sans\', sans-serif;\n  font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px; margin-right: -15px; box-sizing: border-box;\n  color: rgb(102, 102, 102);\\\"><div class=\\\"col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-12\\\" style=\\\"box-sizing:\n  border-box; position: relative; min-height: 1px; padding-left: 15px; padding-right:\n  15px; float: left; width: 756px;\\\"><div class=\\\"image\\\" style=\\\"box-sizing: border-box;\\\"></div></div></div><h2\n  style=\\\"margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 10px; font-family: \'Open Sans\', sans-serif;\n  font-weight: 500; line-height: 1.1; color: rgb(153, 0, 102); box-sizing: border-box;\\\">Reasons</h2><p\n  style=\\\"margin-bottom: 10px; font-family: \'Open Sans\', sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\n  line-height: 20px; box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(102, 102, 102);\\\"><b style=\\\"box-sizing:\n  border-box;\\\">Anatomy</b></p><p style=\\\"margin-bottom: 10px; font-family: \'Open\n  Sans\', sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px; box-sizing: border-box; color:\n  rgb(102, 102, 102);\\\">To&nbsp;better understand what happens when a disc ruptures\n  or herniates, it\'s helpful to know a little about the anatomy of the vertebrae themselves\n  and the different parts of the body that make up the spinal column.&nbsp;</p><p\n  style=\\\"margin-bottom: 10px; font-family: \'Open Sans\', sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\n  line-height: 20px; box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(102, 102, 102);\\\">In between\n  each of your vertebrae is a cushion that acts like a shock-absorber. These are called&nbsp;<i\n  style=\\\"box-sizing: border-box;\\\">intervertebral discs.&nbsp;</i>They are sometimes\n  compared to jelly doughnuts. Each disc has a tough outer ring made up of fibers,\n  that are really a strong ligament that bind the vertebra together. This outer rim\n  is called the&nbsp;<i style=\\\"box-sizing: border-box;\\\">annulus,&nbsp;</i>and it\n  is the strongest part of the disc<i style=\\\"box-sizing: border-box;\\\">.&nbsp;</i>The\n  center of each disc, called the&nbsp;<i style=\\\"box-sizing: border-box;\\\">nucleus\n  pulposus,&nbsp;</i>is filled with a gel-like substance. This soft center is what\n  gives the discs their ability to act as shock-absorbers.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br style=\\\"box-sizing:\n  border-box;\\\"><br style=\\\"box-sizing: border-box;\\\"></p><p style=\\\"margin-bottom:\n  10px; font-family: \'Open Sans\', sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px;\n  box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(102, 102, 102);\\\">When a disc herniates, the\n  tough outer rim is damaged and the soft gel center moves out of its normal space.\n  If the rim is damaged near the spinal canal, the gel material can bulge out and\n  press into the spinal nerves or the spinal cord.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"margin-bottom:\n  10px; font-family: \'Open Sans\', sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px;\n  box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(102, 102, 102);\\\"><b style=\\\"box-sizing: border-box;\\\">Causes\n  of&nbsp;Herniated Discs</b></p><p style=\\\"margin-bottom: 10px; font-family: \'Open\n  Sans\', sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px; box-sizing: border-box; color:\n  rgb(102, 102, 102);\\\">The primary reasons discs herniate is due to normal wear and\n  tear on the spine and the process of aging. As we grow older, the discs between\n  our vertebrae are negatively affected by changes that cause them to dry out and\n  lose some of their elasticity. This is usually a slow process and the herniation\n  develops gradually. Occasionally, events &nbsp;occur that cause a disc to suddenly\n  rupture or herniate. Examples of these types of events are trauma, such as falls\n  or other injuries such as car accidents. Lifting or twisting are other examples\n  of events that can cause a disc to herniate suddenly.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"margin-bottom:\n  10px; font-family: \'Open Sans\', sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px;\n  box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(102, 102, 102);\\\">Most cases of true herniated\n  nucleus pulposus occur in middle-aged and young adults. Children can develop herniated\n  discs, but this occurs rarely. In the elderly, degenerative changes in the spine\n  that normally occur with age make it less likely for a true herniated disc to develop.\n  &nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"margin-bottom: 10px; font-family: \'Open Sans\', sans-serif;\n  font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px; box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(102, 102,\n  102);\\\">If too much pressure is placed suddenly on a disc, rupture can occur. One\n  example of this can be falling from a tree and landing on the buttocks. This type\n  of fall causes a significant amount of force to be placed on the spine all at once.\n  If enough force is experienced, either a vertebra can break or fracture, or a disc\n  can rupture. Bending from the waist also places extreme force on the intervertebral\n  discs. If you try to lift a heavy object while bending, the combination of these\n  forces can cause a ruptured disc. &nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"margin-bottom: 10px; font-family:\n  \'Open Sans\', sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px; box-sizing: border-box;\n  color: rgb(102, 102, 102);\\\">A small amount of force can also cause a ruptured disc.\n  When this occurs, it is usually due to weakening in the fibrous rim of the disc\n  (the&nbsp;<i style=\\\"box-sizing: border-box;\\\">annulus)&nbsp;</i>from repeated trauma\n  that has added up over time. As the annulus becomes weaker, eventually too much\n  force or pressure is applied and it herniates due to its weakened condition. You\n  may be lifting or bending in a way that has never caused a problem before, but due\n  to the aging process of the spine, a rupture occurs.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"margin-bottom:\n  10px; font-family: \'Open Sans\', sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px;\n  box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(102, 102, 102);\\\"></p><p style=\\\"margin-bottom:\n  10px; font-family: \'Open Sans\', sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px;\n  box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(102, 102, 102);\\\">Herniated discs cause problems\n  for two reasons. First, the gel-like substance that leaks into the spinal canal\n  from the nucleus pulposus can exert pressure on the spinal nerves. There is also\n  a possibility that this gel-like material causes a chemical irritation of the nerve\n  roots. The pressure, combined with the irritation, can cause the nerve roots to\n  not function correctly. The result is pain, and/or numbness and weakness in the\n  portion of the body served by the affected nerve.&nbsp;</p><div class=\\\"author\\\"\n  style=\\\"font-family: \'Open Sans\', sans-serif; font-size: 10px; margin-top: -10px;\n  margin-right: 10px; box-sizing: border-box; font-style: italic; float: right; color:\n  rgb(102, 102, 102);\\\"></div><div class=\\\"row\\\" style=\\\"margin-left: -15px; font-family:\n  \'Open Sans\', sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px; margin-right: -15px;\n  box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(102, 102, 102);\\\"></div><h2 style=\\\"margin-top:\n  5px; margin-bottom: 10px; font-family: \'Open Sans\', sans-serif; font-weight: 500;\n  line-height: 1.1; color: rgb(153, 0, 102); box-sizing: border-box;\\\">Symptoms</h2><p\n  style=\\\"margin-bottom: 10px; font-family: \'Open Sans\', sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\n  line-height: 20px; box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(102, 102, 102);\\\">Some people\n  with a true herniated disc do not experience any pain.

In fact, in most cases herniated discs do not require surgical\n  treatment. How a herniated disc is treated depends on the symptoms and whether they\n  are resolving or getting more serious. Your doctor is more likely to recommend surgery\n  if your symptoms are steadily becoming more severe. If your condition is improving,\n  he may recommend a course of treatment that involves watching and waiting to see\n  if your symptoms resolve. Many patients who experience problems because of a herniated\n  disc when it first occurs, find their symptoms completely go away over a period\n  of several weeks or a few months.&nbsp;<br style=\\\"box-sizing: border-box;\\\"></p><h3\n  style=\\\"margin-top: 5px; font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-weight: 400; line-height:\n  1.1; color: rgb(102, 102, 102); box-sizing: border-box;\\\">Conservative Treatment</h3><p\n  style=\\\"margin-bottom: 10px; font-family: \'Open Sans\', sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\n  line-height: 20px; box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(102, 102, 102);\\\">If there\n  are no signs of serious complications resulting from a disc that has herniated,\n  many times doctors will recommend conservative treatment of your symptoms.

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)\n  like aspirin, ibuprofen and naproxen can be purchased over-the-counter and help\n  to relieve pain and decrease the inflammation caused by the disc herniation. These\n  drugs can cause stomach irritation, so should be taken with food. &nbsp;If&nbsp;these\n  medications are not effective, your physician may prescribe stronger medication\n  for your pain such as narcotics, muscle relaxants or other types of medications.\n  Narcotic analgesics can become addictive, and many doctors will not prescribe these\n  for more than a few weeks.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"margin-bottom: 10px; font-family:\n  \'Open Sans\', sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px; box-sizing: border-box;\n  color: rgb(102, 102, 102);\\\"><b style=\\\"box-sizing: border-box;\\\">Epidural Steroid\n  Injection (ESI):</b>&nbsp;An injection of a steroid medication such as prednisone\n  directly into the affected disc area to decrease the pain and inflammation is usually\n  only suggested in cases of severe pain or if surgery is quickly becoming the only\n  other available treatment option.

A small incision is made in between the two vertebrae\n  where the ruptured disc is located. This incision allows the surgeon to visualize\n  the spinal canal. A small portion of the vertebra (the&nbsp;<i style=\\\"box-sizing:\n  border-box;\\\">lamina)&nbsp;</i>usually needs to be removed to make access to the\n  spinal canal possible.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"margin-bottom: 10px; font-family: \'Open\n  Sans\', sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px; box-sizing: border-box; color:\n  rgb(102, 102, 102);\\\">The surgeon then finds the gel-like disc material which has\n  ruptured from the disc and removes it from the spinal canal. This will take the\n  pressure and irritation off the spine. He also removes as much of the material he\n  can that is still inside the disc to prevent it from leaking out (herniating) again.\n  &nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"margin-bottom: 10px; font-family: \'Open Sans\', sans-serif;\n  font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px; box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(102, 102,\n  102);\\\">When the doctor is finished with the procedure, the muscles are replaced\n  into position, and the skin incision is closed with metal staples or sutures.&nbsp;</p><h4\n  style=\\\"margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-weight: 300; line-height:\n  1.1; color: rgb(153, 0, 102); font-size: 16px; box-sizing: border-box; text-transform:\n  uppercase;\\\">MICRO-DISCECTOMY</h4><p style=\\\"margin-bottom: 10px; font-family: \'Open\n  Sans\', sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px; box-sizing: border-box; color:\n  rgb(102, 102, 102);\\\">This procedure is basically the same as the traditional laminotomy\n  and discectomy; however, the incision is much smaller.

C<i style=\\\"box-sizing: border-box;\\\">auda equina syndrome</i>&nbsp; is\n  probably the most serious complication that can occur as a result of a herniated\n  disc. This syndrome results when a large portion of disc material ruptures into\n  the spinal canal in the area where the nerves travel which control bowel and bladder\n  function. &nbsp;Permanent damage to these nerves can result from pressure. If this\n  happens, you may become incontinent (lose control) of bowel and bladder function.\n  This is a rare, but serious condition. If your physician suspects this is happening,\n  he will recommend immediate surgery to get the pressure off the nerves. &nbsp;</p><h4\n  style=\\\"margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-weight: 300; line-height:\n  1.1; color: rgb(153, 0, 102); font-size: 16px; box-sizing: border-box; text-transform:\n  uppercase;\\\">DURING SURGERY</h4><p style=\\\"margin-bottom: 10px; font-family: \'Open\n  Sans\', sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px; box-sizing: border-box; color:\n  rgb(102, 102, 102);\\\">During any type of surgical procedure there is always the\n  risk of complication due to anesthesia. Possible complications during an operation\n  for a herniated disc include:&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"margin-bottom: 10px; font-family:\n  \'Open Sans\', sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px; box-sizing: border-box;\n  color: rgb(102, 102, 102);\\\"><b style=\\\"box-sizing: border-box;\\\">Nerve injury:&nbsp;</b>Removal\n  of herniated disc material involves working near the spinal nerves. During the procedure,\n  the nerves may be damaged or injured. If this happens, you may suffer nerve damage,\n  causing permanent weakness, numbness or pain in the area the nerve travels.&nbsp;</p><p\n  style=\\\"margin-bottom: 10px; font-family: \'Open Sans\', sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\n  line-height: 20px; box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(102, 102, 102);\\\"><b style=\\\"box-sizing:\n  border-box;\\\">Dural Tear:&nbsp;</b>The spinal cord and the spinal nerves are covered\n  with a water-tight bag of tissue which is called the&nbsp;<i style=\\\"box-sizing:\n  border-box;\\\">dura mater.&nbsp;</i>During surgery, a tear can occur in this covering\n  and it is not unusual for this to occur in any type of operation on the spine. &nbsp;If\n  the tear is noticed during the operation, it is repaired and usually heals without\n  further complication. If it goes unnoticed during surgery, the tear may not heal\n  and it can leak spinal fluid. Leakage of spinal fluid can result in problems such\n  as spinal headaches and the risk of infection in the spinal fluid, called&nbsp;<i\n  style=\\\"box-sizing: border-box;\\\">spinal meningitis.&nbsp;</i>If the leak does not\n  heal and seal itself on its own fairly soon after surgery, the tear in the dura\n  may have to be surgically repaired. This would require a second operation. &nbsp;</p><h4\n  style=\\\"margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-weight: 300; line-height:\n  1.1; color: rgb(153, 0, 102); font-size: 16px; box-sizing: border-box; text-transform:\n  uppercase;\\\">AFTER SURGERY:</h4><p style=\\\"margin-bottom: 10px; font-family: \'Open\n  Sans\', sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px; box-sizing: border-box; color:\n  rgb(102, 102, 102);\\\">Some complications do&nbsp;not become apparent until after\n  surgery.

Infection can develop around the nerves in the spinal canal,\n  inside the affected disc or in the incision made in the skin. &nbsp;If infection\n  involves only the incision in your skin, the only treatment needed may be antibiotics.\n  If the infection develops in the disc area or in the spinal canal, you may need\n  further surgery to drain the infection in addition to antibiotics. &nbsp;</p><p\n  style=\\\"margin-bottom: 10px; font-family: \'Open Sans\', sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\n  line-height: 20px; box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(102, 102, 102);\\\"><b style=\\\"box-sizing:\n  border-box;\\\">Re-herniation:</b>&nbsp;There is about a 10-15% chance that the same\n  disc that was operated on will herniate again.

These are called&nbsp;<i\n  style=\\\"box-sizing: border-box;\\\">intervertebral discs.&nbsp;</i>They are sometimes\n  compared to jelly doughnuts. Each disc has a tough outer ring made up of fibers,\n  that are really a strong ligament that bind the vertebra together. This outer rim\n  is called the&nbsp;<i style=\\\"box-sizing: border-box;\\\">annulus,&nbsp;</i>and it\n  is the strongest part of the disc<i style=\\\"box-sizing: border-box;\\\">.&nbsp;</i>The\n  center of each disc, called the&nbsp;<i style=\\\"box-sizing: border-box;\\\">nucleus\n  pulposus,&nbsp;</i>is filled with a gel-like substance. This soft center is what\n  gives the discs their ability to act as shock-absorbers.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br style=\\\"box-sizing:\n  border-box;\\\"><br style=\\\"box-sizing: border-box;\\\"></p><p style=\\\"margin-bottom:\n  10px; font-family: \'Open Sans\', sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px;\n  box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(102, 102, 102);\\\">When a disc herniates, the\n  tough outer rim is damaged and the soft gel center moves out of its normal space.\n  If the rim is damaged near the spinal canal, the gel material can bulge out and\n  press into the spinal nerves or the spinal cord.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"margin-bottom:\n  10px; font-family: \'Open Sans\', sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px;\n  box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(102, 102, 102);\\\"><b style=\\\"box-sizing: border-box;\\\">Causes\n  of&nbsp;Herniated Discs</b></p><p style=\\\"margin-bottom: 10px; font-family: \'Open\n  Sans\', sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px; box-sizing: border-box; color:\n  rgb(102, 102, 102);\\\">The primary reasons discs herniate is due to normal wear and\n  tear on the spine and the process of aging. As we grow older, the discs between\n  our vertebrae are negatively affected by changes that cause them to dry out and\n  lose some of their elasticity. This is usually a slow process and the herniation\n  develops gradually. Occasionally, events &nbsp;occur that cause a disc to suddenly\n  rupture or herniate. Examples of these types of events are trauma, such as falls\n  or other injuries such as car accidents. Lifting or twisting are other examples\n  of events that can cause a disc to herniate suddenly.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"margin-bottom:\n  10px; font-family: \'Open Sans\', sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px;\n  box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(102, 102, 102);\\\">Most cases of true herniated\n  nucleus pulposus occur in middle-aged and young adults. Children can develop herniated\n  discs, but this occurs rarely. In the elderly, degenerative changes in the spine\n  that normally occur with age make it less likely for a true herniated disc to develop.\n  &nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"margin-bottom: 10px; font-family: \'Open Sans\', sans-serif;\n  font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px; box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(102, 102,\n  102);\\\">If too much pressure is placed suddenly on a disc, rupture can occur. One\n  example of this can be falling from a tree and landing on the buttocks. This type\n  of fall causes a significant amount of force to be placed on the spine all at once.\n  If enough force is experienced, either a vertebra can break or fracture, or a disc\n  can rupture. Bending from the waist also places extreme force on the intervertebral\n  discs. If you try to lift a heavy object while bending, the combination of these\n  forces can cause a ruptured disc. &nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"margin-bottom: 10px; font-family:\n  \'Open Sans\', sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px; box-sizing: border-box;\n  color: rgb(102, 102, 102);\\\">A small amount of force can also cause a ruptured disc.\n  When this occurs, it is usually due to weakening in the fibrous rim of the disc\n  (the&nbsp;<i style=\\\"box-sizing: border-box;\\\">annulus)&nbsp;</i>from repeated trauma\n  that has added up over time. As the annulus becomes weaker, eventually too much\n  force or pressure is applied and it herniates due to its weakened condition. You\n  may be lifting or bending in a way that has never caused a problem before, but due\n  to the aging process of the spine, a rupture occurs.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"margin-bottom:\n  10px; font-family: \'Open Sans\', sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px;\n  box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(102, 102, 102);\\\"></p><p style=\\\"margin-bottom:\n  10px; font-family: \'Open Sans\', sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px;\n  box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(102, 102, 102);\\\">Herniated discs cause problems\n  for two reasons. First, the gel-like substance that leaks into the spinal canal\n  from the nucleus pulposus can exert pressure on the spinal nerves. There is also\n  a possibility that this gel-like material causes a chemical irritation of the nerve\n  roots. The pressure, combined with the irritation, can cause the nerve roots to\n  not function correctly.

In fact, in most cases herniated discs do not require surgical\n  treatment. How a herniated disc is treated depends on the symptoms and whether they\n  are resolving or getting more serious. Your doctor is more likely to recommend surgery\n  if your symptoms are steadily becoming more severe. If your condition is improving,\n  he may recommend a course of treatment that involves watching and waiting to see\n  if your symptoms resolve. Many patients who experience problems because of a herniated\n  disc when it first occurs, find their symptoms completely go away over a period\n  of several weeks or a few months.&nbsp;<br style=\\\"box-sizing: border-box;\\\"></p><h3\n  style=\\\"margin-top: 5px; font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-weight: 400; line-height:\n  1.1; color: rgb(102, 102, 102); box-sizing: border-box;\\\">Conservative Treatment</h3><p\n  style=\\\"margin-bottom: 10px; font-family: \'Open Sans\', sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\n  line-height: 20px; box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(102, 102, 102);\\\">If there\n  are no signs of serious complications resulting from a disc that has herniated,\n  many times doctors will recommend conservative treatment of your symptoms. Conservative\n  treatment includes:</p><p style=\\\"margin-bottom: 10px; font-family: \'Open Sans\',\n  sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px; box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(102,\n  102, 102);\\\"><b style=\\\"box-sizing: border-box;\\\">Observation:</b>&nbsp;This involves\n  watching your condition to make sure the herniation does not lead to other serious\n  complications.

After resting for several days, slowly start to increase your activity with\n  gentle tasks such as walking, and gradually increase your activity tolerance. &nbsp;</p><p\n  style=\\\"margin-bottom: 10px; font-family: \'Open Sans\', sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\n  line-height: 20px; box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(102, 102, 102);\\\"><b style=\\\"box-sizing:\n  border-box;\\\">Pain medications:&nbsp;</b>Depending on how severe your pain is, different&nbsp;<i\n  style=\\\"box-sizing: border-box;\\\">analgesics</i>&nbsp;(pain medications) can be\n  used to help you be more comfortable. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)\n  like aspirin, ibuprofen and naproxen can be purchased over-the-counter and help\n  to relieve pain and decrease the inflammation caused by the disc herniation. These\n  drugs can cause stomach irritation, so should be taken with food. &nbsp;If&nbsp;these\n  medications are not effective, your physician may prescribe stronger medication\n  for your pain such as narcotics, muscle relaxants or other types of medications.\n  Narcotic analgesics can become addictive, and many doctors will not prescribe these\n  for more than a few weeks.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"margin-bottom: 10px; font-family:\n  \'Open Sans\', sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px; box-sizing: border-box;\n  color: rgb(102, 102, 102);\\\"><b style=\\\"box-sizing: border-box;\\\">Epidural Steroid\n  Injection (ESI):</b>&nbsp;An injection of a steroid medication such as prednisone\n  directly into the affected disc area to decrease the pain and inflammation is usually\n  only suggested in cases of severe pain or if surgery is quickly becoming the only\n  other available treatment option.

A small incision is made in between the two vertebrae\n  where the ruptured disc is located. This incision allows the surgeon to visualize\n  the spinal canal. A small portion of the vertebra (the&nbsp;<i style=\\\"box-sizing:\n  border-box;\\\">lamina)&nbsp;</i>usually needs to be removed to make access to the\n  spinal canal possible.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"margin-bottom: 10px; font-family: \'Open\n  Sans\', sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px; box-sizing: border-box; color:\n  rgb(102, 102, 102);\\\">The surgeon then finds the gel-like disc material which has\n  ruptured from the disc and removes it from the spinal canal. This will take the\n  pressure and irritation off the spine. He also removes as much of the material he\n  can that is still inside the disc to prevent it from leaking out (herniating) again.\n  &nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"margin-bottom: 10px; font-family: \'Open Sans\', sans-serif;\n  font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px; box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(102, 102,\n  102);\\\">When the doctor is finished with the procedure, the muscles are replaced\n  into position, and the skin incision is closed with metal staples or sutures.&nbsp;</p><h4\n  style=\\\"margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-weight: 300; line-height:\n  1.1; color: rgb(153, 0, 102); font-size: 16px; box-sizing: border-box; text-transform:\n  uppercase;\\\">MICRO-DISCECTOMY</h4><p style=\\\"margin-bottom: 10px; font-family: \'Open\n  Sans\', sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px; box-sizing: border-box; color:\n  rgb(102, 102, 102);\\\">This procedure is basically the same as the traditional laminotomy\n  and discectomy; however, the incision is much smaller.

These are called&nbsp;<i\n  style=\\\"box-sizing: border-box;\\\">intervertebral discs.&nbsp;</i>They are sometimes\n  compared to jelly doughnuts. Each disc has a tough outer ring made up of fibers,\n  that are really a strong ligament that bind the vertebra together. This outer rim\n  is called the&nbsp;<i style=\\\"box-sizing: border-box;\\\">annulus,&nbsp;</i>and it\n  is the strongest part of the disc<i style=\\\"box-sizing: border-box;\\\">.&nbsp;</i>The\n  center of each disc, called the&nbsp;<i style=\\\"box-sizing: border-box;\\\">nucleus\n  pulposus,&nbsp;</i>is filled with a gel-like substance. This soft center is what\n  gives the discs their ability to act as shock-absorbers.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br style=\\\"box-sizing:\n  border-box;\\\"><br style=\\\"box-sizing: border-box;\\\"></p><p style=\\\"margin-bottom:\n  10px; font-family: \'Open Sans\', sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px;\n  box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(102, 102, 102);\\\">When a disc herniates, the\n  tough outer rim is damaged and the soft gel center moves out of its normal space.\n  If the rim is damaged near the spinal canal, the gel material can bulge out and\n  press into the spinal nerves or the spinal cord.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"margin-bottom:\n  10px; font-family: \'Open Sans\', sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px;\n  box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(102, 102, 102);\\\"><b style=\\\"box-sizing: border-box;\\\">Causes\n  of&nbsp;Herniated Discs</b></p><p style=\\\"margin-bottom: 10px; font-family: \'Open\n  Sans\', sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px; box-sizing: border-box; color:\n  rgb(102, 102, 102);\\\">The primary reasons discs herniate is due to normal wear and\n  tear on the spine and the process of aging. As we grow older, the discs between\n  our vertebrae are negatively affected by changes that cause them to dry out and\n  lose some of their elasticity. This is usually a slow process and the herniation\n  develops gradually. Occasionally, events &nbsp;occur that cause a disc to suddenly\n  rupture or herniate. Examples of these types of events are trauma, such as falls\n  or other injuries such as car accidents. Lifting or twisting are other examples\n  of events that can cause a disc to herniate suddenly.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"margin-bottom:\n  10px; font-family: \'Open Sans\', sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px;\n  box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(102, 102, 102);\\\">Most cases of true herniated\n  nucleus pulposus occur in middle-aged and young adults. Children can develop herniated\n  discs, but this occurs rarely. In the elderly, degenerative changes in the spine\n  that normally occur with age make it less likely for a true herniated disc to develop.\n  &nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"margin-bottom: 10px; font-family: \'Open Sans\', sans-serif;\n  font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px; box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(102, 102,\n  102);\\\">If too much pressure is placed suddenly on a disc, rupture can occur. One\n  example of this can be falling from a tree and landing on the buttocks. This type\n  of fall causes a significant amount of force to be placed on the spine all at once.\n  If enough force is experienced, either a vertebra can break or fracture, or a disc\n  can rupture. Bending from the waist also places extreme force on the intervertebral\n  discs. If you try to lift a heavy object while bending, the combination of these\n  forces can cause a ruptured disc. &nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"margin-bottom: 10px; font-family:\n  \'Open Sans\', sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px; box-sizing: border-box;\n  color: rgb(102, 102, 102);\\\">A small amount of force can also cause a ruptured disc.\n  When this occurs, it is usually due to weakening in the fibrous rim of the disc\n  (the&nbsp;<i style=\\\"box-sizing: border-box;\\\">annulus)&nbsp;</i>from repeated trauma\n  that has added up over time. As the annulus becomes weaker, eventually too much\n  force or pressure is applied and it herniates due to its weakened condition. You\n  may be lifting or bending in a way that has never caused a problem before, but due\n  to the aging process of the spine, a rupture occurs.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"margin-bottom:\n  10px; font-family: \'Open Sans\', sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px;\n  box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(102, 102, 102);\\\"></p><p style=\\\"margin-bottom:\n  10px; font-family: \'Open Sans\', sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px;\n  box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(102, 102, 102);\\\">Herniated discs cause problems\n  for two reasons. First, the gel-like substance that leaks into the spinal canal\n  from the nucleus pulposus can exert pressure on the spinal nerves. There is also\n  a possibility that this gel-like material causes a chemical irritation of the nerve\n  roots. The pressure, combined with the irritation, can cause the nerve roots to\n  not function correctly. The result is pain, and/or numbness and weakness in the\n  portion of the body served by the affected nerve.&nbsp;</p><div class=\\\"author\\\"\n  style=\\\"font-family: \'Open Sans\', sans-serif; font-size: 10px; margin-top: -10px;\n  margin-right: 10px; box-sizing: border-box; font-style: italic; float: right; color:\n  rgb(102, 102, 102);\\\"></div><div class=\\\"row\\\" style=\\\"margin-left: -15px; font-family:\n  \'Open Sans\', sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px; margin-right: -15px;\n  box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(102, 102, 102);\\\"></div><h2 style=\\\"margin-top:\n  5px; margin-bottom: 10px; font-family: \'Open Sans\', sans-serif; font-weight: 500;\n  line-height: 1.1; color: rgb(153, 0, 102); box-sizing: border-box;\\\">Symptoms</h2><p\n  style=\\\"margin-bottom: 10px; font-family: \'Open Sans\', sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\n  line-height: 20px; box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(102, 102, 102);\\\">Some people\n  with a true herniated disc do not experience any pain.

If there are no indications of progressive weakness or numbness,\n  and your pain is manageable, your physician may suggest watching and waiting.&nbsp;</p><p\n  style=\\\"margin-bottom: 10px; font-family: \'Open Sans\', sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\n  line-height: 20px; box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(102, 102, 102);\\\"><b style=\\\"box-sizing:\n  border-box;\\\">Rest:</b>&nbsp;If the herniated disc causes more significant pain,\n  your activity may need to be decreased, and you may need a few days away from your\n  job. After resting for several days, slowly start to increase your activity with\n  gentle tasks such as walking, and gradually increase your activity tolerance. &nbsp;</p><p\n  style=\\\"margin-bottom: 10px; font-family: \'Open Sans\', sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\n  line-height: 20px; box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(102, 102, 102);\\\"><b style=\\\"box-sizing:\n  border-box;\\\">Pain medications:&nbsp;</b>Depending on how severe your pain is, different&nbsp;<i\n  style=\\\"box-sizing: border-box;\\\">analgesics</i>&nbsp;(pain medications) can be\n  used to help you be more comfortable. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)\n  like aspirin, ibuprofen and naproxen can be purchased over-the-counter and help\n  to relieve pain and decrease the inflammation caused by the disc herniation. These\n  drugs can cause stomach irritation, so should be taken with food. &nbsp;If&nbsp;these\n  medications are not effective, your physician may prescribe stronger medication\n  for your pain such as narcotics, muscle relaxants or other types of medications.\n  Narcotic analgesics can become addictive, and many doctors will not prescribe these\n  for more than a few weeks.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"margin-bottom: 10px; font-family:\n  \'Open Sans\', sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px; box-sizing: border-box;\n  color: rgb(102, 102, 102);\\\"><b style=\\\"box-sizing: border-box;\\\">Epidural Steroid\n  Injection (ESI):</b>&nbsp;An injection of a steroid medication such as prednisone\n  directly into the affected disc area to decrease the pain and inflammation is usually\n  only suggested in cases of severe pain or if surgery is quickly becoming the only\n  other available treatment option. ESI is only effective as a pain control intervention\n  about 50% of the time.&nbsp;</p><h3 style=\\\"margin-top: 5px; font-family: Roboto,\n  sans-serif; font-weight: 400; line-height: 1.1; color: rgb(102, 102, 102); box-sizing:\n  border-box;\\\">Surgical Treatment</h3><h4 style=\\\"margin-bottom: 0px; font-family:\n  Roboto, sans-serif; font-weight: 300; line-height: 1.1; color: rgb(153, 0, 102);\n  font-size: 16px; box-sizing: border-box; text-transform: uppercase;\\\">LAMINOTOMY\n  AND DISCECTOMY</h4><p style=\\\"margin-bottom: 10px; font-family: \'Open Sans\', sans-serif;\n  font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px; box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(102, 102,\n  102);\\\">The most traditional surgical procedure for treating a herniated disc is\n  the laminotomy and discectomy.&nbsp;<br style=\\\"box-sizing: border-box;\\\"></p><p\n  style=\\\"margin-bottom: 10px; font-family: \'Open Sans\', sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\n  line-height: 20px; box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(102, 102, 102);\\\">In this\n  operation, an incision is made in the back directly over the disc that has herniated.\n  The muscle tissues under the skin are moved so the doctor can see the backbones.\n  It may be necessary to take X-rays during the operation to make sure the correct\n  vertebra and disc are chosen. A small incision is made in between the two vertebrae\n  where the ruptured disc is located. This incision allows the surgeon to visualize\n  the spinal canal. A small portion of the vertebra (the&nbsp;<i style=\\\"box-sizing:\n  border-box;\\\">lamina)&nbsp;</i>usually needs to be removed to make access to the\n  spinal canal possible.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"margin-bottom: 10px; font-family: \'Open\n  Sans\', sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px; box-sizing: border-box; color:\n  rgb(102, 102, 102);\\\">The surgeon then finds the gel-like disc material which has\n  ruptured from the disc and removes it from the spinal canal. This will take the\n  pressure and irritation off the spine. He also removes as much of the material he\n  can that is still inside the disc to prevent it from leaking out (herniating) again.\n  &nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"margin-bottom: 10px; font-family: \'Open Sans\', sans-serif;\n  font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px; box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(102, 102,\n  102);\\\">When the doctor is finished with the procedure, the muscles are replaced\n  into position, and the skin incision is closed with metal staples or sutures.&nbsp;</p><h4\n  style=\\\"margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-weight: 300; line-height:\n  1.1; color: rgb(153, 0, 102); font-size: 16px; box-sizing: border-box; text-transform:\n  uppercase;\\\">MICRO-DISCECTOMY</h4><p style=\\\"margin-bottom: 10px; font-family: \'Open\n  Sans\', sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px; box-sizing: border-box; color:\n  rgb(102, 102, 102);\\\">This procedure is basically the same as the traditional laminotomy\n  and discectomy; however, the incision is much smaller. This means there is less\n  injury to the unaffected parts of your spine during the procedure and recovery may\n  occur more rapidly.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"margin-bottom: 10px; font-family: \'Open\n  Sans\', sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px; box-sizing: border-box; color:\n  rgb(102, 102, 102);\\\">A very small incision is made just over the herniated disc,\n  and the muscles are moved aside as in the traditional procedure. Once the vertebra\n  is seen, an operating microscope is inserted and used to complete the operation.\n  The remainder of the procedure is completed using the same approach as the traditional\n  method.&nbsp;</p><h4 style=\\\"margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: Roboto, sans-serif;\n  font-weight: 300; line-height: 1.1; color: rgb(153, 0, 102); font-size: 16px; box-sizing:\n  border-box; text-transform: uppercase;\\\">ENDOSCOPIC DISCECTOMY</h4><p style=\\\"margin-bottom:\n  10px; font-family: \'Open Sans\', sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px;\n  box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(102, 102, 102);\\\">In this operation, even smaller\n  incisions are needed to insert special television cameras into the spinal canal\n  so the surgeon can visualize the disc material. Other special surgical instruments\n  are also inserted through these small incisions, and the surgeon views the TV screen\n  and guides the instruments to remove the disc material. &nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"margin-bottom:\n  10px; font-family: \'Open Sans\', sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px;\n  box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(102, 102, 102);\\\">This procedure is not yet being\n  widely used and is still evolving. It is beneficial in that the incisions required\n  are very small (1/4 inch), so do even less damage to tissues around the spine than\n  the micro-discectomy. This can mean fewer complications and faster recovery times.</p><h3\n  style=\\\"margin-top: 5px; font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-weight: 400; line-height:\n  1.1; color: rgb(102, 102, 102); box-sizing: border-box;\\\">Complications:</h3><h4\n  style=\\\"margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-weight: 300; line-height:\n  1.1; color: rgb(153, 0, 102); font-size: 16px; box-sizing: border-box; text-transform:\n  uppercase;\\\">BEFORE SURGERY:</h4><p style=\\\"margin-bottom: 10px; font-family: \'Open\n  Sans\', sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px; box-sizing: border-box; color:\n  rgb(102, 102, 102);\\\">Complications from a herniated disc can occur even before\n  surgery. C<i style=\\\"box-sizing: border-box;\\\">auda equina syndrome</i>&nbsp; is\n  probably the most serious complication that can occur as a result of a herniated\n  disc. This syndrome results when a large portion of disc material ruptures into\n  the spinal canal in the area where the nerves travel which control bowel and bladder\n  function. &nbsp;Permanent damage to these nerves can result from pressure. If this\n  happens, you may become incontinent (lose control) of bowel and bladder function.\n  This is a rare, but serious condition. If your physician suspects this is happening,\n  he will recommend immediate surgery to get the pressure off the nerves. &nbsp;</p><h4\n  style=\\\"margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-weight: 300; line-height:\n  1.1; color: rgb(153, 0, 102); font-size: 16px; box-sizing: border-box; text-transform:\n  uppercase;\\\">DURING SURGERY</h4><p style=\\\"margin-bottom: 10px; font-family: \'Open\n  Sans\', sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px; box-sizing: border-box; color:\n  rgb(102, 102, 102);\\\">During any type of surgical procedure there is always the\n  risk of complication due to anesthesia. Possible complications during an operation\n  for a herniated disc include:&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"margin-bottom: 10px; font-family:\n  \'Open Sans\', sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px; box-sizing: border-box;\n  color: rgb(102, 102, 102);\\\"><b style=\\\"box-sizing: border-box;\\\">Nerve injury:&nbsp;</b>Removal\n  of herniated disc material involves working near the spinal nerves. During the procedure,\n  the nerves may be damaged or injured. If this happens, you may suffer nerve damage,\n  causing permanent weakness, numbness or pain in the area the nerve travels.&nbsp;</p><p\n  style=\\\"margin-bottom: 10px; font-family: \'Open Sans\', sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\n  line-height: 20px; box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(102, 102, 102);\\\"><b style=\\\"box-sizing:\n  border-box;\\\">Dural Tear:&nbsp;</b>The spinal cord and the spinal nerves are covered\n  with a water-tight bag of tissue which is called the&nbsp;<i style=\\\"box-sizing:\n  border-box;\\\">dura mater.&nbsp;</i>During surgery, a tear can occur in this covering\n  and it is not unusual for this to occur in any type of operation on the spine. &nbsp;If\n  the tear is noticed during the operation, it is repaired and usually heals without\n  further complication. If it goes unnoticed during surgery, the tear may not heal\n  and it can leak spinal fluid. Leakage of spinal fluid can result in problems such\n  as spinal headaches and the risk of infection in the spinal fluid, called&nbsp;<i\n  style=\\\"box-sizing: border-box;\\\">spinal meningitis.&nbsp;</i>If the leak does not\n  heal and seal itself on its own fairly soon after surgery, the tear in the dura\n  may have to be surgically repaired. This would require a second operation. &nbsp;</p><h4\n  style=\\\"margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-weight: 300; line-height:\n  1.1; color: rgb(153, 0, 102); font-size: 16px; box-sizing: border-box; text-transform:\n  uppercase;\\\">AFTER SURGERY:</h4><p style=\\\"margin-bottom: 10px; font-family: \'Open\n  Sans\', sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px; box-sizing: border-box; color:\n  rgb(102, 102, 102);\\\">Some complications do&nbsp;not become apparent until after\n  surgery. Some become evident soon after your operation and others may take months\n  to show up. Post-surgical complications include:</p><p style=\\\"margin-bottom: 10px;\n  font-family: \'Open Sans\', sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px; box-sizing:\n  border-box; color: rgb(102, 102, 102);\\\"><b style=\\\"box-sizing: border-box;\\\">Infection:\n  &nbsp;</b>All surgical procedures carry some risk for infection and surgery on the\n  spine is no different. Infection can develop around the nerves in the spinal canal,\n  inside the affected disc or in the incision made in the skin. &nbsp;If infection\n  involves only the incision in your skin, the only treatment needed may be antibiotics.\n  If the infection develops in the disc area or in the spinal canal, you may need\n  further surgery to drain the infection in addition to antibiotics. &nbsp;</p><p\n  style=\\\"margin-bottom: 10px; font-family: \'Open Sans\', sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\n  line-height: 20px; box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(102, 102, 102);\\\"><b style=\\\"box-sizing:\n  border-box;\\\">Re-herniation:</b>&nbsp;There is about a 10-15% chance that the same\n  disc that was operated on will herniate again. This usually occurs within the first\n  six weeks following your surgery, but it may happen anytime. If this occurs, you\n  may need another operation.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"margin-bottom: 10px; font-family:\n  \'Open Sans\', sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px; box-sizing: border-box;\n  color: rgb(102, 102, 102);\\\"><b style=\\\"box-sizing: border-box;\\\">Persistent pain:&nbsp;</b>Surgery\n  does not always eliminate pain.

These are called&nbsp;<i\n  style=\\\"box-sizing: border-box;\\\">intervertebral discs.&nbsp;</i>They are sometimes\n  compared to jelly doughnuts. Each disc has a tough outer ring made up of fibers,\n  that are really a strong ligament that bind the vertebra together. This outer rim\n  is called the&nbsp;<i style=\\\"box-sizing: border-box;\\\">annulus,&nbsp;</i>and it\n  is the strongest part of the disc<i style=\\\"box-sizing: border-box;\\\">.&nbsp;</i>The\n  center of each disc, called the&nbsp;<i style=\\\"box-sizing: border-box;\\\">nucleus\n  pulposus,&nbsp;</i>is filled with a gel-like substance. This soft center is what\n  gives the discs their ability to act as shock-absorbers.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br style=\\\"box-sizing:\n  border-box;\\\"><br style=\\\"box-sizing: border-box;\\\"></p><p style=\\\"margin-bottom:\n  10px; font-family: \'Open Sans\', sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px;\n  box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(102, 102, 102);\\\">When a disc herniates, the\n  tough outer rim is damaged and the soft gel center moves out of its normal space.\n  If the rim is damaged near the spinal canal, the gel material can bulge out and\n  press into the spinal nerves or the spinal cord.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"margin-bottom:\n  10px; font-family: \'Open Sans\', sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px;\n  box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(102, 102, 102);\\\"><b style=\\\"box-sizing: border-box;\\\">Causes\n  of&nbsp;Herniated Discs</b></p><p style=\\\"margin-bottom: 10px; font-family: \'Open\n  Sans\', sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px; box-sizing: border-box; color:\n  rgb(102, 102, 102);\\\">The primary reasons discs herniate is due to normal wear and\n  tear on the spine and the process of aging. As we grow older, the discs between\n  our vertebrae are negatively affected by changes that cause them to dry out and\n  lose some of their elasticity. This is usually a slow process and the herniation\n  develops gradually. Occasionally, events &nbsp;occur that cause a disc to suddenly\n  rupture or herniate. Examples of these types of events are trauma, such as falls\n  or other injuries such as car accidents. Lifting or twisting are other examples\n  of events that can cause a disc to herniate suddenly.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"margin-bottom:\n  10px; font-family: \'Open Sans\', sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px;\n  box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(102, 102, 102);\\\">Most cases of true herniated\n  nucleus pulposus occur in middle-aged and young adults. Children can develop herniated\n  discs, but this occurs rarely. In the elderly, degenerative changes in the spine\n  that normally occur with age make it less likely for a true herniated disc to develop.\n  &nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"margin-bottom: 10px; font-family: \'Open Sans\', sans-serif;\n  font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px; box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(102, 102,\n  102);\\\">If too much pressure is placed suddenly on a disc, rupture can occur. One\n  example of this can be falling from a tree and landing on the buttocks. This type\n  of fall causes a significant amount of force to be placed on the spine all at once.\n  If enough force is experienced, either a vertebra can break or fracture, or a disc\n  can rupture. Bending from the waist also places extreme force on the intervertebral\n  discs. If you try to lift a heavy object while bending, the combination of these\n  forces can cause a ruptured disc. &nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"margin-bottom: 10px; font-family:\n  \'Open Sans\', sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px; box-sizing: border-box;\n  color: rgb(102, 102, 102);\\\">A small amount of force can also cause a ruptured disc.\n  When this occurs, it is usually due to weakening in the fibrous rim of the disc\n  (the&nbsp;<i style=\\\"box-sizing: border-box;\\\">annulus)&nbsp;</i>from repeated trauma\n  that has added up over time. As the annulus becomes weaker, eventually too much\n  force or pressure is applied and it herniates due to its weakened condition. You\n  may be lifting or bending in a way that has never caused a problem before, but due\n  to the aging process of the spine, a rupture occurs.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"margin-bottom:\n  10px; font-family: \'Open Sans\', sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px;\n  box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(102, 102, 102);\\\"></p><p style=\\\"margin-bottom:\n  10px; font-family: \'Open Sans\', sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px;\n  box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(102, 102, 102);\\\">Herniated discs cause problems\n  for two reasons. First, the gel-like substance that leaks into the spinal canal\n  from the nucleus pulposus can exert pressure on the spinal nerves. There is also\n  a possibility that this gel-like material causes a chemical irritation of the nerve\n  roots. The pressure, combined with the irritation, can cause the nerve roots to\n  not function correctly. The result is pain, and/or numbness and weakness in the\n  portion of the body served by the affected nerve.&nbsp;</p><div class=\\\"author\\\"\n  style=\\\"font-family: \'Open Sans\', sans-serif; font-size: 10px; margin-top: -10px;\n  margin-right: 10px; box-sizing: border-box; font-style: italic; float: right; color:\n  rgb(102, 102, 102);\\\"></div><div class=\\\"row\\\" style=\\\"margin-left: -15px; font-family:\n  \'Open Sans\', sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px; margin-right: -15px;\n  box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(102, 102, 102);\\\"></div><h2 style=\\\"margin-top:\n  5px; margin-bottom: 10px; font-family: \'Open Sans\', sans-serif; font-weight: 500;\n  line-height: 1.1; color: rgb(153, 0, 102); box-sizing: border-box;\\\">Symptoms</h2><p\n  style=\\\"margin-bottom: 10px; font-family: \'Open Sans\', sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\n  line-height: 20px; box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(102, 102, 102);\\\">Some people\n  with a true herniated disc do not experience any pain.

In fact, in most cases herniated discs do not require surgical\n  treatment. How a herniated disc is treated depends on the symptoms and whether they\n  are resolving or getting more serious. Your doctor is more likely to recommend surgery\n  if your symptoms are steadily becoming more severe. If your condition is improving,\n  he may recommend a course of treatment that involves watching and waiting to see\n  if your symptoms resolve. Many patients who experience problems because of a herniated\n  disc when it first occurs, find their symptoms completely go away over a period\n  of several weeks or a few months.&nbsp;<br style=\\\"box-sizing: border-box;\\\"></p><h3\n  style=\\\"margin-top: 5px; font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-weight: 400; line-height:\n  1.1; color: rgb(102, 102, 102); box-sizing: border-box;\\\">Conservative Treatment</h3><p\n  style=\\\"margin-bottom: 10px; font-family: \'Open Sans\', sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\n  line-height: 20px; box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(102, 102, 102);\\\">If there\n  are no signs of serious complications resulting from a disc that has herniated,\n  many times doctors will recommend conservative treatment of your symptoms. Conservative\n  treatment includes:</p><p style=\\\"margin-bottom: 10px; font-family: \'Open Sans\',\n  sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px; box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(102,\n  102, 102);\\\"><b style=\\\"box-sizing: border-box;\\\">Observation:</b>&nbsp;This involves\n  watching your condition to make sure the herniation does not lead to other serious\n  complications.

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)\n  like aspirin, ibuprofen and naproxen can be purchased over-the-counter and help\n  to relieve pain and decrease the inflammation caused by the disc herniation. These\n  drugs can cause stomach irritation, so should be taken with food. &nbsp;If&nbsp;these\n  medications are not effective, your physician may prescribe stronger medication\n  for your pain such as narcotics, muscle relaxants or other types of medications.\n  Narcotic analgesics can become addictive, and many doctors will not prescribe these\n  for more than a few weeks.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"margin-bottom: 10px; font-family:\n  \'Open Sans\', sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px; box-sizing: border-box;\n  color: rgb(102, 102, 102);\\\"><b style=\\\"box-sizing: border-box;\\\">Epidural Steroid\n  Injection (ESI):</b>&nbsp;An injection of a steroid medication such as prednisone\n  directly into the affected disc area to decrease the pain and inflammation is usually\n  only suggested in cases of severe pain or if surgery is quickly becoming the only\n  other available treatment option.

A small incision is made in between the two vertebrae\n  where the ruptured disc is located. This incision allows the surgeon to visualize\n  the spinal canal. A small portion of the vertebra (the&nbsp;<i style=\\\"box-sizing:\n  border-box;\\\">lamina)&nbsp;</i>usually needs to be removed to make access to the\n  spinal canal possible.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"margin-bottom: 10px; font-family: \'Open\n  Sans\', sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px; box-sizing: border-box; color:\n  rgb(102, 102, 102);\\\">The surgeon then finds the gel-like disc material which has\n  ruptured from the disc and removes it from the spinal canal. This will take the\n  pressure and irritation off the spine. He also removes as much of the material he\n  can that is still inside the disc to prevent it from leaking out (herniating) again.\n  &nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"margin-bottom: 10px; font-family: \'Open Sans\', sans-serif;\n  font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px; box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(102, 102,\n  102);\\\">When the doctor is finished with the procedure, the muscles are replaced\n  into position, and the skin incision is closed with metal staples or sutures.&nbsp;</p><h4\n  style=\\\"margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-weight: 300; line-height:\n  1.1; color: rgb(153, 0, 102); font-size: 16px; box-sizing: border-box; text-transform:\n  uppercase;\\\">MICRO-DISCECTOMY</h4><p style=\\\"margin-bottom: 10px; font-family: \'Open\n  Sans\', sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px; box-sizing: border-box; color:\n  rgb(102, 102, 102);\\\">This procedure is basically the same as the traditional laminotomy\n  and discectomy; however, the incision is much smaller.

C<i style=\\\"box-sizing: border-box;\\\">auda equina syndrome</i>&nbsp; is\n  probably the most serious complication that can occur as a result of a herniated\n  disc. This syndrome results when a large portion of disc material ruptures into\n  the spinal canal in the area where the nerves travel which control bowel and bladder\n  function. &nbsp;Permanent damage to these nerves can result from pressure. If this\n  happens, you may become incontinent (lose control) of bowel and bladder function.\n  This is a rare, but serious condition. If your physician suspects this is happening,\n  he will recommend immediate surgery to get the pressure off the nerves. &nbsp;</p><h4\n  style=\\\"margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-weight: 300; line-height:\n  1.1; color: rgb(153, 0, 102); font-size: 16px; box-sizing: border-box; text-transform:\n  uppercase;\\\">DURING SURGERY</h4><p style=\\\"margin-bottom: 10px; font-family: \'Open\n  Sans\', sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px; box-sizing: border-box; color:\n  rgb(102, 102, 102);\\\">During any type of surgical procedure there is always the\n  risk of complication due to anesthesia.

During the procedure,\n  the nerves may be damaged or injured. If this happens, you may suffer nerve damage,\n  causing permanent weakness, numbness or pain in the area the nerve travels.&nbsp;</p><p\n  style=\\\"margin-bottom: 10px; font-family: \'Open Sans\', sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\n  line-height: 20px; box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(102, 102, 102);\\\"><b style=\\\"box-sizing:\n  border-box;\\\">Dural Tear:&nbsp;</b>The spinal cord and the spinal nerves are covered\n  with a water-tight bag of tissue which is called the&nbsp;<i style=\\\"box-sizing:\n  border-box;\\\">dura mater.&nbsp;</i>During surgery, a tear can occur in this covering\n  and it is not unusual for this to occur in any type of operation on the spine. &nbsp;If\n  the tear is noticed during the operation, it is repaired and usually heals without\n  further complication. If it goes unnoticed during surgery, the tear may not heal\n  and it can leak spinal fluid. Leakage of spinal fluid can result in problems such\n  as spinal headaches and the risk of infection in the spinal fluid, called&nbsp;<i\n  style=\\\"box-sizing: border-box;\\\">spinal meningitis.&nbsp;</i>If the leak does not\n  heal and seal itself on its own fairly soon after surgery, the tear in the dura\n  may have to be surgically repaired.

Infection can develop around the nerves in the spinal canal,\n  inside the affected disc or in the incision made in the skin. &nbsp;If infection\n  involves only the incision in your skin, the only treatment needed may be antibiotics.\n  If the infection develops in the disc area or in the spinal canal, you may need\n  further surgery to drain the infection in addition to antibiotics. &nbsp;</p><p\n  style=\\\"margin-bottom: 10px; font-family: \'Open Sans\', sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\n  line-height: 20px; box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(102, 102, 102);\\\"><b style=\\\"box-sizing:\n  border-box;\\\">Re-herniation:</b>&nbsp;There is about a 10-15% chance that the same\n  disc that was operated on will herniate again.

These\n  are called intervertebral discs. They are sometimes compared to jelly doughnuts.\n  Each disc has a tough outer ring made up of fibers, that are really a strong ligament\n  that bind the vertebra together. This outer rim is called the annulus, and it is\n  the strongest part of the disc. The center of each disc, called the nucleus pulposus,\n  is filled with a gel-like substance. This soft center is what gives the discs their\n  ability to act as shock-absorbers.</p>\\r\\n  <p>When a disc herniates, the tough\n  outer rim is damaged and the soft gel center moves out of its normal space. If the\n  rim is damaged near the spinal canal, the gel material can bulge out and press into\n  the spinal nerves or the spinal cord.</p>\\r\\n</div>\\r\\n<h3>Causes of Herniated Discs</h3>\\r\\n<p>The\n  primary reasons discs herniate is due to normal wear and tear on the spine and the\n  process of aging. As we grow older, the discs between our vertebrae are negatively\n  affected by changes that cause them to dry out and lose some of their elasticity.\n  This is usually a slow process and the herniation develops gradually. Occasionally,\n  events  occur that cause a disc to suddenly rupture or herniate. Examples of these\n  types of events are trauma, such as falls or other injuries such as car accidents.\n  Lifting or twisting are other examples of events that can cause a disc to herniate\n  suddenly.</p>\\r\\n<img src=\\\"images/img05.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"image description\\\" class=\\\"alignleft\\\"\n  />\\r\\n<p>Most cases of true herniated nucleus pulposus occur in middle-aged and\n  young adults. Children can develop herniated discs, but this occurs rarely. In the\n  elderly, degenerative changes in the spine that normally occur with age make it\n  less likely for a true herniated disc to develop.</p>\\r\\n<p>If too much pressure\n  is placed suddenly on a disc, rupture can occur. One example of this can be falling\n  from a tree and landing on the buttocks. This type of fall causes a significant\n  amount of force to be placed on the spine all at once. If enough force is experienced,\n  either a vertebra can break or fracture, or a disc can rupture. Bending from the\n  waist also places extreme force on the intervertebral discs. If you try to lift\n  a heavy object while bending, the combination of these forces can cause a ruptured\n  disc.</p>\\r\\n<img src=\\\"images/img06.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"image description\\\" class=\\\"alignright\\\"\n  />\\r\\n<p>A small amount of force can also cause a ruptured disc. When this occurs,\n  it is usually due to weakening in the fibrous rim of the disc (the annulus) from\n  repeated trauma that has added up over time. As the annulus becomes weaker, eventually\n  too much force or pressure is applied and it herniates due to its weakened condition.\n  You may be lifting or bending in a way that has never caused a problem before, but\n  due to the aging process of the spine, a rupture occurs.</p>\\r\\n<p>Herniated discs\n  cause problems for two reasons. First, the gel-like substance that leaks into the\n  spinal canal from the nucleus pulposus can exert pressure on the spinal nerves.\n  There is also a possibility that this gel-like material causes a chemical irritation\n  of the nerve roots. The pressure, combined with the irritation, can cause the nerve\n  roots to not function correctly. The result is pain, and/or numbness and weakness\n  in the portion of the body served by the affected nerve.</p>\\r\\n\"\nposition: 1\n',NULL,'2015-02-21 09:49:39'),(34,'Rhinoart::Page',1,'update','1','---\nid: 1\nparent_id: \nname: Herniated Disc in the Cervical, Thoracic, & Lumbar Spine\nslug: index\nposition: 1\nmenu: 1\nactive: true\nptype: page\nsm_p: weekly\nst_pr: 0.5\ncreated_at: 2015-02-20 16:40:15.000000000 Z\nupdated_at: 2015-02-21 09:45:47.000000000 Z\npublish_date: 2015-02-20\nuser_id: \n',NULL,'2015-02-21 09:49:39'),(35,'Rhinoart::PageContent',1,'update','1','---\nid: 1\npage_id: 1\nname: main_content\ncontent: \"<div>\\r\\n  <div class=\\\"heading-block\\\">\\r\\n    <h2>Definition</h2>\\r\\n\n  \\ </div>\\r\\n  <p>A herniated disc occurs when the nucleus pulposus, which is the\n  gel-like inner substance of an intervertebral disc, breaks through the annulus fibrosus,\n  which is the tough, outer rim of the tire-like structure.

This is usually a\n  slow process and the herniation develops gradually. Occasionally, events  occur\n  that cause a disc to suddenly rupture or herniate. Examples of these types of events\n  are trauma, such as falls or other injuries such as car accidents. Lifting or twisting\n  are other examples of events that can cause a disc to herniate suddenly.</p>\\r\\n\n  \\ <img src=\\\"images/img05.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"image description\\\" class=\\\"alignleft\\\" />\\r\\n\n  \\ <p>Most cases of true herniated nucleus pulposus occur in middle-aged and young\n  adults. Children can develop herniated discs, but this occurs rarely. In the elderly,\n  degenerative changes in the spine that normally occur with age make it less likely\n  for a true herniated disc to develop.</p>\\r\\n  <p>If too much pressure is placed\n  suddenly on a disc, rupture can occur. One example of this can be falling from a\n  tree and landing on the buttocks. This type of fall causes a significant amount\n  of force to be placed on the spine all at once. If enough force is experienced,\n  either a vertebra can break or fracture, or a disc can rupture. Bending from the\n  waist also places extreme force on the intervertebral discs. If you try to lift\n  a heavy object while bending, the combination of these forces can cause a ruptured\n  disc.</p>\\r\\n  <img src=\\\"images/img06.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"image description\\\" class=\\\"alignright\\\"\n  />\\r\\n  <p>A small amount of force can also cause a ruptured disc. When this occurs,\n  it is usually due to weakening in the fibrous rim of the disc (the annulus) from\n  repeated trauma that has added up over time. As the annulus becomes weaker, eventually\n  too much force or pressure is applied and it herniates due to its weakened condition.\n  You may be lifting or bending in a way that has never caused a problem before, but\n  due to the aging process of the spine, a rupture occurs.</p>\\r\\n  <p>Herniated discs\n  cause problems for two reasons. First, the gel-like substance that leaks into the\n  spinal canal from the nucleus pulposus can exert pressure on the spinal nerves.\n  There is also a possibility that this gel-like material causes a chemical irritation\n  of the nerve roots. The pressure, combined with the irritation, can cause the nerve\n  roots to not function correctly. The result is pain, and/or numbness and weakness\n  in the portion of the body served by the affected nerve.</p>\\r\\n</div>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<div\n  id=\\\"symptoms\\\">\\r\\n  <div class=\\\"heading-block\\\">\\r\\n    <h2>Symptoms</h2>\\r\\n\n  \\ </div>\\r\\n  <p>Some people with a true herniated disc do not experience any pain.\n  The symptoms of the problem come from the pressure that is placed on the spinal\n  nerves and from irritation.

How a\n  herniated disc is treated depends on the symptoms and whether they are resolving\n  or getting more serious. Your doctor is more likely to recommend surgery if your\n  symptoms are steadily becoming more severe. If your condition is improving, he may\n  recommend a course of treatment that involves watching and waiting to see if your\n  symptoms resolve. Many patients who experience problems because of a herniated disc\n  when it first occurs, find their symptoms completely go away over a period of several\n  weeks or a few months. </p>\\r\\n  </div>\\r\\n  <div class=\\\"clear\\\">\\r\\n    <h3>Conservative\n  Treatment</h3>\\r\\n    <p>If there are no signs of serious complications resulting\n  from a disc that has herniated, many times doctors will recommend conservative treatment\n  of your symptoms. Conservative treatment includes:</p>\\r\\n    <p>Observation: This\n  involves watching your condition to make sure the herniation does not lead to other\n  serious complications. If there are no indications of progressive weakness or numbness,\n  and your pain is manageable, your physician may suggest watching and waiting.</p>\\r\\n\n  \\   <p>Rest: If the herniated disc causes more significant pain, your activity may\n  need to be decreased, and you may need a few days away from your job. After resting\n  for several days, slowly start to increase your activity with gentle tasks such\n  as walking, and gradually increase your activity tolerance.</p>\\r\\n    <p>Pain medications:\n  Depending on how severe your pain is, different analgesics (pain medications) can\n  be used to help you be more comfortable. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)\n  like aspirin, ibuprofen and naproxen can be purchased over-the-counter and help\n  to relieve pain and decrease the inflammation caused by the disc herniation. These\n  drugs can cause stomach irritation, so should be taken with food.  If these medications\n  are not effective, your physician may prescribe stronger medication for your pain\n  such as narcotics, muscle relaxants or other types of medications. Narcotic analgesics\n  can become addictive, and many doctors will not prescribe these for more than a\n  few weeks.</p>\\r\\n    <p>Epidural Steroid Injection (ESI): An injection of a steroid\n  medication such as prednisone directly into the affected disc area to decrease the\n  pain and inflammation is usually only suggested in cases of severe pain or if surgery\n  is quickly becoming the only other available treatment option. ESI is only effective\n  as a pain control intervention about 50% of the time.</p>\\r\\n  </div>\\r\\n  <h3>Surgical\n  Treatment</h3>\\r\\n  <div class=\\\"clear\\\">\\r\\n    <h4>Laminotomy and Discectomy</h4>\\r\\n\n  \\   <p>The most traditional surgical procedure for treating a herniated disc is\n  the laminotomy and discectomy.</p>\\r\\n    <p>In this operation, an incision is made\n  in the back directly over the disc that has herniated. The muscle tissues under\n  the skin are moved so the doctor can see the backbones. It may be necessary to take\n  X-rays during the operation to make sure the correct vertebra and disc are chosen.\n  A small incision is made in between the two vertebrae where the ruptured disc is\n  located. This incision allows the surgeon to visualize the spinal canal. A small\n  portion of the vertebra (the lamina) usually needs to be removed to make access\n  to the spinal canal possible.</p>\\r\\n    <p>The surgeon then finds the gel-like\n  disc material which has ruptured from the disc and removes it from the spinal canal.\n  This will take the pressure and irritation off the spine. He also removes as much\n  of the material he can that is still inside the disc to prevent it from leaking\n  out (herniating) again.</p>\\r\\n    <p>When the doctor is finished with the procedure,\n  the muscles are replaced into position, and the skin incision is closed with metal\n  staples or sutures.</p>\\r\\n    <img src=\\\"images/img08.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"image description\\\"\n  class=\\\"aligncenter\\\" />\\r\\n  </div>\\r\\n  <div class=\\\"clear\\\">\\r\\n    <h4>Micro-discectomy</h4>\\r\\n\n  \\   <p>This procedure is basically the same as the traditional laminotomy and discectomy;\n  however, the incision is much smaller. This means there is less injury to the unaffected\n  parts of your spine during the procedure and recovery may occur more rapidly.</p>\\r\\n\n  \\   <p>A very small incision is made just over the herniated disc, and the muscles\n  are moved aside as in the traditional procedure. Once the vertebra is seen, an operating\n  microscope is inserted and used to complete the operation. The remainder of the\n  procedure is completed using the same approach as the traditional method.</p>\\r\\n\n  \\ </div>\\r\\n  <div class=\\\"clear\\\">\\r\\n    <h4>Endoscopic Discectomy</h4>\\r\\n    <p>In\n  this operation, even smaller incisions are needed to insert special television cameras\n  into the spinal canal so the surgeon can visualize the disc material. Other special\n  surgical instruments are also inserted through these small incisions, and the surgeon\n  views the TV screen and guides the instruments to remove the disc material.</p>\\r\\n\n  \\   <p>This procedure is not yet being widely used and is still evolving. It is\n  beneficial in that the incisions required are very small (1/4 inch), so do even\n  less damage to tissues around the spine than the micro-discectomy. This can mean\n  fewer complications and faster recovery times.</p>\\r\\n  </div>\\r\\n  <div class=\\\"clear\\\">\\r\\n\n  \\   <h3>Complications</h3>\\r\\n    <h4>Before surgery</h4>\\r\\n    <p>Complications\n  from a herniated disc can occur even before surgery. Cauda equina syndrome  is probably\n  the most serious complication that can occur as a result of a herniated disc. This\n  syndrome results when a large portion of disc material ruptures into the spinal\n  canal in the area where the nerves travel which control bowel and bladder function.\n  \\ Permanent damage to these nerves can result from pressure. If this happens, you\n  may become incontinent (lose control) of bowel and bladder function. This is a rare,\n  but serious condition. If your physician suspects this is happening, he will recommend\n  immediate surgery to get the pressure off the nerves.  </p>\\r\\n  </div>\\r\\n  <div\n  class=\\\"clear\\\">\\r\\n    <h4>During surgery</h4>\\r\\n    <p>During any type of surgical\n  procedure there is always the risk of complication due to anesthesia. Possible complications\n  during an operation for a herniated disc include:</p>\\r\\n    <p>Nerve injury: Removal\n  of herniated disc material involves working near the spinal nerves. During the procedure,\n  the nerves may be damaged or injured. If this happens, you may suffer nerve damage,\n  causing permanent weakness, numbness or pain in the area the nerve travels.</p>\\r\\n\n  \\   <p>Dural Tear: The spinal cord and the spinal nerves are covered with a water-tight\n  bag of tissue which is called the dura mater. During surgery, a tear can occur in\n  this covering and it is not unusual for this to occur in any type of operation on\n  the spine.  If the tear is noticed during the operation, it is repaired and usually\n  heals without further complication. If it goes unnoticed during surgery, the tear\n  may not heal and it can leak spinal fluid. Leakage of spinal fluid can result in\n  problems such as spinal headaches and the risk of infection in the spinal fluid,\n  called spinal meningitis. If the leak does not heal and seal itself on its own fairly\n  soon after surgery, the tear in the dura may have to be surgically repaired. This\n  would require a second operation.</p>\\r\\n  </div>\\r\\n  <div class=\\\"clear\\\">\\r\\n\n  \\   <h4>After surgery</h4>\\r\\n    <p>Some complications do not become apparent until\n  after surgery. Some become evident soon after your operation and others may take\n  months to show up. Post-surgical complications include:</p>\\r\\n    <p><span>Infection:</span>\n  \\ All surgical procedures carry some risk for infection and surgery on the spine\n  is no different. Infection can develop around the nerves in the spinal canal, inside\n  the affected disc or in the incision made in the skin.  If infection involves only\n  the incision in your skin, the only treatment needed may be antibiotics. If the\n  infection develops in the disc area or in the spinal canal, you may need further\n  surgery to drain the infection in addition to antibiotics.</p>\\r\\n    <p><span>Re-herniation:</span>\n  There is about a 10-15% chance that the same disc that was operated on will herniate\n  again. This usually occurs within the first six weeks following your surgery, but\n  it may happen anytime. If this occurs, you may need another operation.</p>\\r\\n    <p><span>Persistent\n  pain:</span> Surgery does not always eliminate pain. There are many reasons people\n  continue to have pain despite back surgery. These reasons include:</p>\\r\\n    <ul>\\r\\n\n  \\     <li>If the nerves have been damaged by pressure caused from the herniated\n  disc, complete recovery may not be possible.</li>\\r\\n      <li>Scar tissue may form\n  around the nerves following surgery. This puts pressure on the nerves and causes\n  pain similar to the pain caused by the herniated disc.</li>\\r\\n      <li>The pain\n  you were having prior to surgery may be from issues in addition to disc herniation\n  that were not solved by removing the herniated disc.</li>\\r\\n    </ul>\\r\\n    <p><span>Degenerative\n  disc Disease:</span>  Any time a disc is injured, the injury can lead to degeneration\n  in that portion of the spine. A disc that has been surgically altered can certainly\n  be considered as \\\"injured.\\\" This places the surrounding area of the spine at increased\n  risk for degenerative changes to occur.  The degenerative process is very slow,\n  usually taking several years to occur, but if the changes caused by degeneration\n  become severe, a second surgery may be needed.</p>\\r\\n  </div>\\r\\n  <div class=\\\"clear\\\">\\r\\n\n  \\   <h3>Rehabilitation</h3>\\r\\n    <img src=\\\"images/img09.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"image description\\\"\n  class=\\\"aligncenter\\\" />\\r\\n    <p>Following your operation, your physician will\n  probably recommend physical therapy before you begin an exercise routine on your\n  own. A skilled therapist will help you choose exercises that are safe and effective\n  for you as an individual. Exercise is essential to your recovery as well as to maintaining\n  your spine health over time. It\'s the easiest and most sensible way to combat problems\n  with your back.</p>\\r\\n    <p>Research has shown that exercise, done on a regular\n  basis is linked to fewer back problems. It has many benefits for your spine health\n  including:</p>\\r\\n    <ul>\\r\\n      <li>Strengthening: It can help strengthen your\n  core muscles that help support your spine, and also can strengthen the muscles of\n  your arms and legs. Strength in your muscles reduces back strain.</li>\\r\\n      <li>Exercise\n  can reduce your risk of falling and sustaining injuries.</li>\\r\\n      <li>Stretching\n  exercises decrease the risk of painful spasms in the muscles.</li>\\r\\n      <li>Weight-bearing\n  exercise helps to prevent osteoporosis, which in turn decreases your risk of compression\n  fractures.</li>\\r\\n      <li>Aerobic exercise, the kind that increases your heart\n  rate, can help to relieve pain.

This outer rim is called the annulus, and it is\n  the strongest part of the disc. The center of each disc, called the nucleus pulposus,\n  is filled with a gel-like substance. This soft center is what gives the discs their\n  ability to act as shock-absorbers.</p>\\r\\n    <p>When a disc herniates, the tough\n  outer rim is damaged and the soft gel center moves out of its normal space.

ESI is only effective\n  as a pain control intervention about 50% of the time.</p>\\r\\n  </div>\\r\\n  <h3>Surgical\n  Treatment</h3>\\r\\n  <div class=\\\"clear\\\">\\r\\n    <h4>Laminotomy and Discectomy</h4>\\r\\n\n  \\   <p>The most traditional surgical procedure for treating a herniated disc is\n  the laminotomy and discectomy.</p>\\r\\n    <p>In this operation, an incision is made\n  in the back directly over the disc that has herniated. The muscle tissues under\n  the skin are moved so the doctor can see the backbones. It may be necessary to take\n  X-rays during the operation to make sure the correct vertebra and disc are chosen.\n  A small incision is made in between the two vertebrae where the ruptured disc is\n  located. This incision allows the surgeon to visualize the spinal canal. A small\n  portion of the vertebra (the lamina) usually needs to be removed to make access\n  to the spinal canal possible.</p>\\r\\n    <p>The surgeon then finds the gel-like\n  disc material which has ruptured from the disc and removes it from the spinal canal.\n  This will take the pressure and irritation off the spine. He also removes as much\n  of the material he can that is still inside the disc to prevent it from leaking\n  out (herniating) again.</p>\\r\\n    <p>When the doctor is finished with the procedure,\n  the muscles are replaced into position, and the skin incision is closed with metal\n  staples or sutures.</p>\\r\\n    <img src=\\\"images/img08.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"image description\\\"\n  class=\\\"aligncenter\\\">\\r\\n  </div>\\r\\n  <div class=\\\"clear\\\">\\r\\n    <h4>Micro-discectomy</h4>\\r\\n\n  \\   <p>This procedure is basically the same as the traditional laminotomy and discectomy;\n  however, the incision is much smaller. This means there is less injury to the unaffected\n  parts of your spine during the procedure and recovery may occur more rapidly.</p>\\r\\n\n  \\   <p>A very small incision is made just over the herniated disc, and the muscles\n  are moved aside as in the traditional procedure. Once the vertebra is seen, an operating\n  microscope is inserted and used to complete the operation. The remainder of the\n  procedure is completed using the same approach as the traditional method.</p>\\r\\n\n  \\ </div>\\r\\n  <div class=\\\"clear\\\">\\r\\n    <h4>Endoscopic Discectomy</h4>\\r\\n    <p>In\n  this operation, even smaller incisions are needed to insert special television cameras\n  into the spinal canal so the surgeon can visualize the disc material. Other special\n  surgical instruments are also inserted through these small incisions, and the surgeon\n  views the TV screen and guides the instruments to remove the disc material.</p>\\r\\n\n  \\   <p>This procedure is not yet being widely used and is still evolving. It is\n  beneficial in that the incisions required are very small (1/4 inch), so do even\n  less damage to tissues around the spine than the micro-discectomy. This can mean\n  fewer complications and faster recovery times.</p>\\r\\n  </div>\\r\\n  <div class=\\\"clear\\\">\\r\\n\n  \\   <h3>Complications</h3>\\r\\n    <h4>Before surgery</h4>\\r\\n    <p>Complications\n  from a herniated disc can occur even before surgery. Cauda equina syndrome  is probably\n  the most serious complication that can occur as a result of a herniated disc. This\n  syndrome results when a large portion of disc material ruptures into the spinal\n  canal in the area where the nerves travel which control bowel and bladder function.\n  \\ Permanent damage to these nerves can result from pressure. If this happens, you\n  may become incontinent (lose control) of bowel and bladder function. This is a rare,\n  but serious condition. If your physician suspects this is happening, he will recommend\n  immediate surgery to get the pressure off the nerves.  </p>\\r\\n  </div>\\r\\n  <div\n  class=\\\"clear\\\">\\r\\n    <h4>During surgery</h4>\\r\\n    <p>During any type of surgical\n  procedure there is always the risk of complication due to anesthesia. Possible complications\n  during an operation for a herniated disc include:</p>\\r\\n    <p>Nerve injury: Removal\n  of herniated disc material involves working near the spinal nerves. During the procedure,\n  the nerves may be damaged or injured. If this happens, you may suffer nerve damage,\n  causing permanent weakness, numbness or pain in the area the nerve travels.</p>\\r\\n\n  \\   <p>Dural Tear: The spinal cord and the spinal nerves are covered with a water-tight\n  bag of tissue which is called the dura mater. During surgery, a tear can occur in\n  this covering and it is not unusual for this to occur in any type of operation on\n  the spine.  If the tear is noticed during the operation, it is repaired and usually\n  heals without further complication. If it goes unnoticed during surgery, the tear\n  may not heal and it can leak spinal fluid. Leakage of spinal fluid can result in\n  problems such as spinal headaches and the risk of infection in the spinal fluid,\n  called spinal meningitis. If the leak does not heal and seal itself on its own fairly\n  soon after surgery, the tear in the dura may have to be surgically repaired. This\n  would require a second operation.</p>\\r\\n  </div>\\r\\n  <div class=\\\"clear\\\">\\r\\n\n  \\   <h4>After surgery</h4>\\r\\n    <p>Some complications do not become apparent until\n  after surgery. Some become evident soon after your operation and others may take\n  months to show up. Post-surgical complications include:</p>\\r\\n    <p><span>Infection:</span>\n  \\ All surgical procedures carry some risk for infection and surgery on the spine\n  is no different. Infection can develop around the nerves in the spinal canal, inside\n  the affected disc or in the incision made in the skin.  If infection involves only\n  the incision in your skin, the only treatment needed may be antibiotics. If the\n  infection develops in the disc area or in the spinal canal, you may need further\n  surgery to drain the infection in addition to antibiotics.</p>\\r\\n    <p><span>Re-herniation:</span>\n  There is about a 10-15% chance that the same disc that was operated on will herniate\n  again. This usually occurs within the first six weeks following your surgery, but\n  it may happen anytime. If this occurs, you may need another operation.</p>\\r\\n    <p><span>Persistent\n  pain:</span> Surgery does not always eliminate pain. There are many reasons people\n  continue to have pain despite back surgery. These reasons include:</p>\\r\\n    <ul>\\r\\n\n  \\     <li>If the nerves have been damaged by pressure caused from the herniated\n  disc, complete recovery may not be possible.</li>\\r\\n      <li>Scar tissue may form\n  around the nerves following surgery. This puts pressure on the nerves and causes\n  pain similar to the pain caused by the herniated disc.</li>\\r\\n      <li>The pain\n  you were having prior to surgery may be from issues in addition to disc herniation\n  that were not solved by removing the herniated disc.</li>\\r\\n    </ul>\\r\\n    <p><span>Degenerative\n  disc Disease:</span>  Any time a disc is injured, the injury can lead to degeneration\n  in that portion of the spine. A disc that has been surgically altered can certainly\n  be considered as \\\"injured.\\\" This places the surrounding area of the spine at increased\n  risk for degenerative changes to occur.  The degenerative process is very slow,\n  usually taking several years to occur, but if the changes caused by degeneration\n  become severe, a second surgery may be needed.</p>\\r\\n  </div>\\r\\n  <div class=\\\"clear\\\">\\r\\n\n  \\   <h3>Rehabilitation</h3>\\r\\n    <img src=\\\"images/img09.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"image description\\\"\n  class=\\\"aligncenter\\\">\\r\\n    <p>Following your operation, your physician will probably\n  recommend physical therapy before you begin an exercise routine on your own. A skilled\n  therapist will help you choose exercises that are safe and effective for you as\n  an individual. Exercise is essential to your recovery as well as to maintaining\n  your spine health over time. It\'s the easiest and most sensible way to combat problems\n  with your back.</p>\\r\\n    <p>Research has shown that exercise, done on a regular\n  basis is linked to fewer back problems. It has many benefits for your spine health\n  including:</p>\\r\\n    <ul>\\r\\n      <li>Strengthening: It can help strengthen your\n  core muscles that help support your spine, and also can strengthen the muscles of\n  your arms and legs. Strength in your muscles reduces back strain.</li>\\r\\n      <li>Exercise\n  can reduce your risk of falling and sustaining injuries.</li>\\r\\n      <li>Stretching\n  exercises decrease the risk of painful spasms in the muscles.</li>\\r\\n      <li>Weight-bearing\n  exercise helps to prevent osteoporosis, which in turn decreases your risk of compression\n  fractures.</li>\\r\\n      <li>Aerobic exercise, the kind that increases your heart\n  rate, can help to relieve pain. It stimulates the body to release its own \\\"feel\n  good\\\" chemicals, called endorphins.</li>\\r\\n    </ul>\\r\\n  </div>\\r\\n</div>\\r\\n\"\nposition: 1\n',NULL,'2015-02-21 09:51:32'),(38,'Rhinoart::Page',1,'update','1','---\nid: 1\nparent_id: \nname: Herniated Disc in the Cervical, Thoracic, & Lumbar Spine\nslug: index\nposition: 1\nmenu: 1\nactive: true\nptype: page\nsm_p: weekly\nst_pr: 0.5\ncreated_at: 2015-02-20 16:40:15.000000000 Z\nupdated_at: 2015-02-21 09:50:34.000000000 Z\npublish_date: 2015-02-20\nuser_id: \n',NULL,'2015-02-21 09:51:33'),(39,'Rhinoart::PageContent',1,'update','1','---\nid: 1\npage_id: 1\nname: main_content\ncontent: \"<div>\\r\\n  <div class=\\\"heading-block\\\">\\r\\n    <h2>Definition</h2>\\r\\n\n  \\ </div>\\r\\n  <p>A herniated disc occurs when the nucleus pulposus, which is the\n  gel-like inner substance of an intervertebral disc, breaks through the annulus fibrosus,\n  which is the tough, outer rim of the tire-like structure.

However, nerve compression and inflammation can cause other symptoms including\n  numbness, tingling and/or weakness in the extremities.</p>\\r\\n  <p>Disc herniation\n  can cause other symptoms, including reflex dysfunction or an abnormal reflex response\n  in the arms or legs, depending on where in the vertebral column the disc rupture\n  occurs. </p>\\r\\n  <div class=\\\"clear\\\">\\r\\n    <a href=\\\"#\\\" class=\\\"alignright\\\"><img\n  src=\\\"/uploads/images/img02.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"Herniated-disc\\\"></a>\\r\\n    <ul>\\r\\n      <li><span>Cervical\n  Spine:</span> If a disc ruptures in the upper spine area, neck pain main result\n  which radiates into the shoulders or arms.</li>\\r\\n      <li><span>Thoracic Spine:</span>\n  Mid-spine disc herniation is uncommon.

These\n  are called intervertebral discs. They are sometimes compared to jelly doughnuts.\n  Each disc has a tough outer ring made up of fibers, that are really a strong ligament\n  that bind the vertebra together. This outer rim is called the annulus, and it is\n  the strongest part of the disc. The center of each disc, called the nucleus pulposus,\n  is filled with a gel-like substance. This soft center is what gives the discs their\n  ability to act as shock-absorbers.</p>\\r\\n    <p>When a disc herniates, the tough\n  outer rim is damaged and the soft gel center moves out of its normal space. If the\n  rim is damaged near the spinal canal, the gel material can bulge out and press into\n  the spinal nerves or the spinal cord.</p>\\r\\n  </div>\\r\\n  <h3>Causes of Herniated\n  Discs</h3>\\r\\n  <p>The primary reasons discs herniate is due to normal wear and\n  tear on the spine and the process of aging. As we grow older, the discs between\n  our vertebrae are negatively affected by changes that cause them to dry out and\n  lose some of their elasticity. This is usually a slow process and the herniation\n  develops gradually. Occasionally, events  occur that cause a disc to suddenly rupture\n  or herniate. Examples of these types of events are trauma, such as falls or other\n  injuries such as car accidents. Lifting or twisting are other examples of events\n  that can cause a disc to herniate suddenly.</p>\\r\\n  <img src=\\\"images/img05.jpg\\\"\n  alt=\\\"image description\\\" class=\\\"alignleft\\\">\\r\\n  <p>Most cases of true herniated\n  nucleus pulposus occur in middle-aged and young adults. Children can develop herniated\n  discs, but this occurs rarely. In the elderly, degenerative changes in the spine\n  that normally occur with age make it less likely for a true herniated disc to develop.</p>\\r\\n\n  \\ <p>If too much pressure is placed suddenly on a disc, rupture can occur. One example\n  of this can be falling from a tree and landing on the buttocks. This type of fall\n  causes a significant amount of force to be placed on the spine all at once. If enough\n  force is experienced, either a vertebra can break or fracture, or a disc can rupture.\n  Bending from the waist also places extreme force on the intervertebral discs. If\n  you try to lift a heavy object while bending, the combination of these forces can\n  cause a ruptured disc.</p>\\r\\n  <img src=\\\"images/img06.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"image description\\\"\n  class=\\\"alignright\\\">\\r\\n  <p>A small amount of force can also cause a ruptured\n  disc. When this occurs, it is usually due to weakening in the fibrous rim of the\n  disc (the annulus) from repeated trauma that has added up over time. As the annulus\n  becomes weaker, eventually too much force or pressure is applied and it herniates\n  due to its weakened condition. You may be lifting or bending in a way that has never\n  caused a problem before, but due to the aging process of the spine, a rupture occurs.</p>\\r\\n\n  \\ <p>Herniated discs cause problems for two reasons. First, the gel-like substance\n  that leaks into the spinal canal from the nucleus pulposus can exert pressure on\n  the spinal nerves. There is also a possibility that this gel-like material causes\n  a chemical irritation of the nerve roots. The pressure, combined with the irritation,\n  can cause the nerve roots to not function correctly. The result is pain, and/or\n  numbness and weakness in the portion of the body served by the affected nerve.</p>\\r\\n</div>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<div\n  id=\\\"symptoms\\\">\\r\\n  <div class=\\\"heading-block\\\">\\r\\n    <h2>Symptoms</h2>\\r\\n\n  \\ </div>\\r\\n  <p>Some people with a true herniated disc do not experience any pain.\n  The symptoms of the problem come from the pressure that is placed on the spinal\n  nerves and from irritation. Many people who have disc herniation do have pain due\n  to other problems with their back that were present when the disc ruptured. Typical\n  symptoms of a herniated lumbar disc include:</p>\\r\\n  <ul>\\r\\n    <li>Pain that\n  radiates into one leg or into both legs</li>\\r\\n    <li>Tingling or numbness in\n  areas of one leg or both legs</li>\\r\\n    <li>Weakness in certain muscles of one\n  leg or both legs</li>\\r\\n    <li>Absence of reflexes in one leg or both legs</li>\\r\\n\n  \\ </ul>\\r\\n  <p>The location of these symptoms varies depending on which nerve or\n  nerves have been compressed in the spinal column. The location of the symptoms will\n  help your physician determine the correct diagnosis. By knowing where you are experiencing\n  pain, your doctor will have a better idea of the location of the ruptured disc.\n  \\ </p>\\r\\n</div>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<div id=\\\"diagnostic\\\">\\r\\n  <div class=\\\"heading-block\\\">\\r\\n\n  \\   <h2>Diagnostic procedures</h2>\\r\\n  </div>\\r\\n  <img src=\\\"images/img07.jpg\\\"\n  alt=\\\"image description\\\" class=\\\"alignright\\\">\\r\\n  <p>If your physician suspects\n  a herniated disc, he will obtain your medical history and complete a thorough physical\n  examination as well as neurological tests. He will observe your spine while you\n  are standing and while walking and may ask you to complete other movements to assess\n  your mobility and balance. He will examine your spine for any sign of abnormality\n  and will check your reflexes, assess sensation and look for any sign of weakness.\n  He will ask about your pain and other symptoms.</p>\\r\\n  <p>Your physician may recommend\n  imaging tests to help confirm the diagnosis of a herniated disc. He may order tests\n  such as X-rays, an MRI or a CT scan.</p>\\r\\n</div>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<div id=\\\"treatment\\\">\\r\\n\n  \\ <div class=\\\"heading-block\\\">\\r\\n    <h2>Treatment</h2>\\r\\n  </div>\\r\\n  <div\n  class=\\\"clear\\\">\\r\\n    <p>Not every case of a disc herniation requires surgery.\n  In fact, in most cases herniated discs do not require surgical treatment. How a\n  herniated disc is treated depends on the symptoms and whether they are resolving\n  or getting more serious. Your doctor is more likely to recommend surgery if your\n  symptoms are steadily becoming more severe. If your condition is improving, he may\n  recommend a course of treatment that involves watching and waiting to see if your\n  symptoms resolve. Many patients who experience problems because of a herniated disc\n  when it first occurs, find their symptoms completely go away over a period of several\n  weeks or a few months. </p>\\r\\n  </div>\\r\\n  <div class=\\\"clear\\\">\\r\\n    <h3>Conservative\n  Treatment</h3>\\r\\n    <p>If there are no signs of serious complications resulting\n  from a disc that has herniated, many times doctors will recommend conservative treatment\n  of your symptoms. Conservative treatment includes:</p>\\r\\n    <p>Observation: This\n  involves watching your condition to make sure the herniation does not lead to other\n  serious complications. If there are no indications of progressive weakness or numbness,\n  and your pain is manageable, your physician may suggest watching and waiting.</p>\\r\\n\n  \\   <p>Rest: If the herniated disc causes more significant pain, your activity may\n  need to be decreased, and you may need a few days away from your job. After resting\n  for several days, slowly start to increase your activity with gentle tasks such\n  as walking, and gradually increase your activity tolerance.</p>\\r\\n    <p>Pain medications:\n  Depending on how severe your pain is, different analgesics (pain medications) can\n  be used to help you be more comfortable. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)\n  like aspirin, ibuprofen and naproxen can be purchased over-the-counter and help\n  to relieve pain and decrease the inflammation caused by the disc herniation. These\n  drugs can cause stomach irritation, so should be taken with food.  If these medications\n  are not effective, your physician may prescribe stronger medication for your pain\n  such as narcotics, muscle relaxants or other types of medications. Narcotic analgesics\n  can become addictive, and many doctors will not prescribe these for more than a\n  few weeks.</p>\\r\\n    <p>Epidural Steroid Injection (ESI): An injection of a steroid\n  medication such as prednisone directly into the affected disc area to decrease the\n  pain and inflammation is usually only suggested in cases of severe pain or if surgery\n  is quickly becoming the only other available treatment option.

These\n  are called intervertebral discs. They are sometimes compared to jelly doughnuts.\n  Each disc has a tough outer ring made up of fibers, that are really a strong ligament\n  that bind the vertebra together. This outer rim is called the annulus, and it is\n  the strongest part of the disc. The center of each disc, called the nucleus pulposus,\n  is filled with a gel-like substance. This soft center is what gives the discs their\n  ability to act as shock-absorbers.</p>\\r\\n    <p>When a disc herniates, the tough\n  outer rim is damaged and the soft gel center moves out of its normal space. If the\n  rim is damaged near the spinal canal, the gel material can bulge out and press into\n  the spinal nerves or the spinal cord.</p>\\r\\n  </div>\\r\\n  <h3>Causes of Herniated\n  Discs</h3>\\r\\n  <p>The primary reasons discs herniate is due to normal wear and\n  tear on the spine and the process of aging. As we grow older, the discs between\n  our vertebrae are negatively affected by changes that cause them to dry out and\n  lose some of their elasticity. This is usually a slow process and the herniation\n  develops gradually. Occasionally, events  occur that cause a disc to suddenly rupture\n  or herniate. Examples of these types of events are trauma, such as falls or other\n  injuries such as car accidents. Lifting or twisting are other examples of events\n  that can cause a disc to herniate suddenly.</p>\\r\\n  \\r\\n  <p>Most cases of true\n  herniated nucleus pulposus occur in middle-aged and young adults. Children can develop\n  herniated discs, but this occurs rarely. In the elderly, degenerative changes in\n  the spine that normally occur with age make it less likely for a true herniated\n  disc to develop.</p>\\r\\n  <p>If too much pressure is placed suddenly on a disc,\n  rupture can occur. One example of this can be falling from a tree and landing on\n  the buttocks. This type of fall causes a significant amount of force to be placed\n  on the spine all at once. If enough force is experienced, either a vertebra can\n  break or fracture, or a disc can rupture. Bending from the waist also places extreme\n  force on the intervertebral discs. If you try to lift a heavy object while bending,\n  the combination of these forces can cause a ruptured disc.</p>\\r\\n  \\r\\n  <p>A small\n  amount of force can also cause a ruptured disc. When this occurs, it is usually\n  due to weakening in the fibrous rim of the disc (the annulus) from repeated trauma\n  that has added up over time. As the annulus becomes weaker, eventually too much\n  force or pressure is applied and it herniates due to its weakened condition. You\n  may be lifting or bending in a way that has never caused a problem before, but due\n  to the aging process of the spine, a rupture occurs.</p>\\r\\n  <p>Herniated discs\n  cause problems for two reasons. First, the gel-like substance that leaks into the\n  spinal canal from the nucleus pulposus can exert pressure on the spinal nerves.\n  There is also a possibility that this gel-like material causes a chemical irritation\n  of the nerve roots. The pressure, combined with the irritation, can cause the nerve\n  roots to not function correctly. The result is pain, and/or numbness and weakness\n  in the portion of the body served by the affected nerve.</p>\\r\\n</div>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<div\n  id=\\\"symptoms\\\">\\r\\n  <div class=\\\"heading-block\\\">\\r\\n    <h2>Symptoms</h2>\\r\\n\n  \\ </div>\\r\\n  <p>Some people with a true herniated disc do not experience any pain.\n  The symptoms of the problem come from the pressure that is placed on the spinal\n  nerves and from irritation. Many people who have disc herniation do have pain due\n  to other problems with their back that were present when the disc ruptured. Typical\n  symptoms of a herniated lumbar disc include:</p>\\r\\n  <ul>\\r\\n    <li>Pain that\n  radiates into one leg or into both legs</li>\\r\\n    <li>Tingling or numbness in\n  areas of one leg or both legs</li>\\r\\n    <li>Weakness in certain muscles of one\n  leg or both legs</li>\\r\\n    <li>Absence of reflexes in one leg or both legs</li>\\r\\n\n  \\ </ul>\\r\\n  <p>The location of these symptoms varies depending on which nerve or\n  nerves have been compressed in the spinal column. The location of the symptoms will\n  help your physician determine the correct diagnosis. By knowing where you are experiencing\n  pain, your doctor will have a better idea of the location of the ruptured disc.\n  \\ </p>\\r\\n</div>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<div id=\\\"diagnostic\\\">\\r\\n  <div class=\\\"heading-block\\\">\\r\\n\n  \\   <h2>Diagnostic procedures</h2>\\r\\n  </div>\\r\\n  \\r\\n  <p>If your physician suspects\n  a herniated disc, he will obtain your medical history and complete a thorough physical\n  examination as well as neurological tests. He will observe your spine while you\n  are standing and while walking and may ask you to complete other movements to assess\n  your mobility and balance. He will examine your spine for any sign of abnormality\n  and will check your reflexes, assess sensation and look for any sign of weakness.\n  He will ask about your pain and other symptoms.</p>\\r\\n  <p>Your physician may recommend\n  imaging tests to help confirm the diagnosis of a herniated disc. He may order tests\n  such as X-rays, an MRI or a CT scan.</p>\\r\\n</div>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<div id=\\\"treatment\\\">\\r\\n\n  \\ <div class=\\\"heading-block\\\">\\r\\n    <h2>Treatment</h2>\\r\\n  </div>\\r\\n  <div\n  class=\\\"clear\\\">\\r\\n    <p>Not every case of a disc herniation requires surgery.\n  In fact, in most cases herniated discs do not require surgical treatment. How a\n  herniated disc is treated depends on the symptoms and whether they are resolving\n  or getting more serious. Your doctor is more likely to recommend surgery if your\n  symptoms are steadily becoming more severe. If your condition is improving, he may\n  recommend a course of treatment that involves watching and waiting to see if your\n  symptoms resolve. Many patients who experience problems because of a herniated disc\n  when it first occurs, find their symptoms completely go away over a period of several\n  weeks or a few months. </p>\\r\\n  </div>\\r\\n  <div class=\\\"clear\\\">\\r\\n    <h3>Conservative\n  Treatment</h3>\\r\\n    <p>If there are no signs of serious complications resulting\n  from a disc that has herniated, many times doctors will recommend conservative treatment\n  of your symptoms. Conservative treatment includes:</p>\\r\\n    <p>Observation: This\n  involves watching your condition to make sure the herniation does not lead to other\n  serious complications. If there are no indications of progressive weakness or numbness,\n  and your pain is manageable, your physician may suggest watching and waiting.</p>\\r\\n\n  \\   <p>Rest: If the herniated disc causes more significant pain, your activity may\n  need to be decreased, and you may need a few days away from your job. After resting\n  for several days, slowly start to increase your activity with gentle tasks such\n  as walking, and gradually increase your activity tolerance.</p>\\r\\n    <p>Pain medications:\n  Depending on how severe your pain is, different analgesics (pain medications) can\n  be used to help you be more comfortable. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)\n  like aspirin, ibuprofen and naproxen can be purchased over-the-counter and help\n  to relieve pain and decrease the inflammation caused by the disc herniation. These\n  drugs can cause stomach irritation, so should be taken with food.  If these medications\n  are not effective, your physician may prescribe stronger medication for your pain\n  such as narcotics, muscle relaxants or other types of medications. Narcotic analgesics\n  can become addictive, and many doctors will not prescribe these for more than a\n  few weeks.</p>\\r\\n    <p>Epidural Steroid Injection (ESI): An injection of a steroid\n  medication such as prednisone directly into the affected disc area to decrease the\n  pain and inflammation is usually only suggested in cases of severe pain or if surgery\n  is quickly becoming the only other available treatment option. ESI is only effective\n  as a pain control intervention about 50% of the time.</p>\\r\\n  </div>\\r\\n  <h3>Surgical\n  Treatment</h3>\\r\\n  <div class=\\\"clear\\\">\\r\\n    <h4>Laminotomy and Discectomy</h4>\\r\\n\n  \\   <p>The most traditional surgical procedure for treating a herniated disc is\n  the laminotomy and discectomy.</p>\\r\\n    <p>In this operation, an incision is made\n  in the back directly over the disc that has herniated. The muscle tissues under\n  the skin are moved so the doctor can see the backbones. It may be necessary to take\n  X-rays during the operation to make sure the correct vertebra and disc are chosen.\n  A small incision is made in between the two vertebrae where the ruptured disc is\n  located. This incision allows the surgeon to visualize the spinal canal. A small\n  portion of the vertebra (the lamina) usually needs to be removed to make access\n  to the spinal canal possible.</p>\\r\\n    <p>The surgeon then finds the gel-like\n  disc material which has ruptured from the disc and removes it from the spinal canal.\n  This will take the pressure and irritation off the spine. He also removes as much\n  of the material he can that is still inside the disc to prevent it from leaking\n  out (herniating) again.</p>\\r\\n    <p>When the doctor is finished with the procedure,\n  the muscles are replaced into position, and the skin incision is closed with metal\n  staples or sutures.</p>\\r\\n    \\r\\n  </div>\\r\\n  <div class=\\\"clear\\\">\\r\\n    <h4>Micro-discectomy</h4>\\r\\n\n  \\   <p>This procedure is basically the same as the traditional laminotomy and discectomy;\n  however, the incision is much smaller. This means there is less injury to the unaffected\n  parts of your spine during the procedure and recovery may occur more rapidly.</p>\\r\\n\n  \\   <p>A very small incision is made just over the herniated disc, and the muscles\n  are moved aside as in the traditional procedure. Once the vertebra is seen, an operating\n  microscope is inserted and used to complete the operation. The remainder of the\n  procedure is completed using the same approach as the traditional method.</p>\\r\\n\n  \\ </div>\\r\\n  <div class=\\\"clear\\\">\\r\\n    <h4>Endoscopic Discectomy</h4>\\r\\n    <p>In\n  this operation, even smaller incisions are needed to insert special television cameras\n  into the spinal canal so the surgeon can visualize the disc material. Other special\n  surgical instruments are also inserted through these small incisions, and the surgeon\n  views the TV screen and guides the instruments to remove the disc material.</p>\\r\\n\n  \\   <p>This procedure is not yet being widely used and is still evolving. It is\n  beneficial in that the incisions required are very small (1/4 inch), so do even\n  less damage to tissues around the spine than the micro-discectomy. This can mean\n  fewer complications and faster recovery times.</p>\\r\\n  </div>\\r\\n  <div class=\\\"clear\\\">\\r\\n\n  \\   <h3>Complications</h3>\\r\\n    <h4>Before surgery</h4>\\r\\n    <p>Complications\n  from a herniated disc can occur even before surgery. Cauda equina syndrome  is probably\n  the most serious complication that can occur as a result of a herniated disc. This\n  syndrome results when a large portion of disc material ruptures into the spinal\n  canal in the area where the nerves travel which control bowel and bladder function.\n  \\ Permanent damage to these nerves can result from pressure. If this happens, you\n  may become incontinent (lose control) of bowel and bladder function. This is a rare,\n  but serious condition. If your physician suspects this is happening, he will recommend\n  immediate surgery to get the pressure off the nerves.  </p>\\r\\n  </div>\\r\\n  <div\n  class=\\\"clear\\\">\\r\\n    <h4>During surgery</h4>\\r\\n    <p>During any type of surgical\n  procedure there is always the risk of complication due to anesthesia. Possible complications\n  during an operation for a herniated disc include:</p>\\r\\n    <p>Nerve injury: Removal\n  of herniated disc material involves working near the spinal nerves. During the procedure,\n  the nerves may be damaged or injured. If this happens, you may suffer nerve damage,\n  causing permanent weakness, numbness or pain in the area the nerve travels.</p>\\r\\n\n  \\   <p>Dural Tear: The spinal cord and the spinal nerves are covered with a water-tight\n  bag of tissue which is called the dura mater. During surgery, a tear can occur in\n  this covering and it is not unusual for this to occur in any type of operation on\n  the spine.  If the tear is noticed during the operation, it is repaired and usually\n  heals without further complication. If it goes unnoticed during surgery, the tear\n  may not heal and it can leak spinal fluid. Leakage of spinal fluid can result in\n  problems such as spinal headaches and the risk of infection in the spinal fluid,\n  called spinal meningitis. If the leak does not heal and seal itself on its own fairly\n  soon after surgery, the tear in the dura may have to be surgically repaired. This\n  would require a second operation.</p>\\r\\n  </div>\\r\\n  <div class=\\\"clear\\\">\\r\\n\n  \\   <h4>After surgery</h4>\\r\\n    <p>Some complications do not become apparent until\n  after surgery. Some become evident soon after your operation and others may take\n  months to show up. Post-surgical complications include:</p>\\r\\n    <p><span>Infection:</span>\n  \\ All surgical procedures carry some risk for infection and surgery on the spine\n  is no different. Infection can develop around the nerves in the spinal canal, inside\n  the affected disc or in the incision made in the skin.  If infection involves only\n  the incision in your skin, the only treatment needed may be antibiotics. If the\n  infection develops in the disc area or in the spinal canal, you may need further\n  surgery to drain the infection in addition to antibiotics.</p>\\r\\n    <p><span>Re-herniation:</span>\n  There is about a 10-15% chance that the same disc that was operated on will herniate\n  again. This usually occurs within the first six weeks following your surgery, but\n  it may happen anytime. If this occurs, you may need another operation.</p>\\r\\n    <p><span>Persistent\n  pain:</span> Surgery does not always eliminate pain. There are many reasons people\n  continue to have pain despite back surgery. These reasons include:</p>\\r\\n    <ul>\\r\\n\n  \\     <li>If the nerves have been damaged by pressure caused from the herniated\n  disc, complete recovery may not be possible.</li>\\r\\n      <li>Scar tissue may form\n  around the nerves following surgery. This puts pressure on the nerves and causes\n  pain similar to the pain caused by the herniated disc.</li>\\r\\n      <li>The pain\n  you were having prior to surgery may be from issues in addition to disc herniation\n  that were not solved by removing the herniated disc.</li>\\r\\n    </ul>\\r\\n    <p><span>Degenerative\n  disc Disease:</span>  Any time a disc is injured, the injury can lead to degeneration\n  in that portion of the spine. A disc that has been surgically altered can certainly\n  be considered as \\\"injured.\\\" This places the surrounding area of the spine at increased\n  risk for degenerative changes to occur.

These are called&nbsp;<i style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\">intervertebral\n  discs.&nbsp;</i>They are sometimes compared to jelly doughnuts. Each disc has a\n  tough outer ring made up of fibers, that are really a strong ligament that bind\n  the vertebra together. This outer rim is called the&nbsp;<i style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\">annulus,&nbsp;</i>and\n  it is the strongest part of the disc<i style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\">.&nbsp;</i>The\n  center of each disc, called the&nbsp;<i style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\">nucleus\n  pulposus,&nbsp;</i>is filled with a gel-like substance. This soft center is what\n  gives the discs their ability to act as shock-absorbers.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br style=\"box-sizing:\n  border-box;\"><br style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\"></p><p style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\n  margin-bottom: 10px; color: rgb(102, 102, 102); font-family: \'\'Open Sans\'\', sans-serif;\n  font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px;\">When a disc herniates, the tough outer rim\n  is damaged and the soft gel center moves out of its normal space. If the rim is\n  damaged near the spinal canal, the gel material can bulge out and press into the\n  spinal nerves or the spinal cord.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom:\n  10px; color: rgb(102, 102, 102); font-family: \'\'Open Sans\'\', sans-serif; font-size:\n  14px; line-height: 20px;\"><b style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\">Causes of&nbsp;Herniated\n  Discs</b></p><p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 10px; color: rgb(102,\n  102, 102); font-family: \'\'Open Sans\'\', sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height:\n  20px;\">The primary reasons discs herniate is due to normal wear and tear on the\n  spine and the process of aging. As we grow older, the discs between our vertebrae\n  are negatively affected by changes that cause them to dry out and lose some of their\n  elasticity. This is usually a slow process and the herniation develops gradually.\n  Occasionally, events &nbsp;occur that cause a disc to suddenly rupture or herniate.\n  Examples of these types of events are trauma, such as falls or other injuries such\n  as car accidents. Lifting or twisting are other examples of events that can cause\n  a disc to herniate suddenly.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom:\n  10px; color: rgb(102, 102, 102); font-family: \'\'Open Sans\'\', sans-serif; font-size:\n  14px; line-height: 20px;\">Most cases of true herniated nucleus pulposus occur in\n  middle-aged and young adults. Children can develop herniated discs, but this occurs\n  rarely. In the elderly, degenerative changes in the spine that normally occur with\n  age make it less likely for a true herniated disc to develop. &nbsp;</p><p style=\"box-sizing:\n  border-box; margin-bottom: 10px; color: rgb(102, 102, 102); font-family: \'\'Open\n  Sans\'\', sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px;\">If too much pressure is\n  placed suddenly on a disc, rupture can occur. One example of this can be falling\n  from a tree and landing on the buttocks. This type of fall causes a significant\n  amount of force to be placed on the spine all at once. If enough force is experienced,\n  either a vertebra can break or fracture, or a disc can rupture. Bending from the\n  waist also places extreme force on the intervertebral discs. If you try to lift\n  a heavy object while bending, the combination of these forces can cause a ruptured\n  disc. &nbsp;</p><p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 10px; color: rgb(102,\n  102, 102); font-family: \'\'Open Sans\'\', sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height:\n  20px;\">A small amount of force can also cause a ruptured disc. When this occurs,\n  it is usually due to weakening in the fibrous rim of the disc (the&nbsp;<i style=\"box-sizing:\n  border-box;\">annulus)&nbsp;</i>from repeated trauma that has added up over time.\n  As the annulus becomes weaker, eventually too much force or pressure is applied\n  and it herniates due to its weakened condition. You may be lifting or bending in\n  a way that has never caused a problem before, but due to the aging process of the\n  spine, a rupture occurs.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom:\n  10px; color: rgb(102, 102, 102); font-family: \'\'Open Sans\'\', sans-serif; font-size:\n  14px; line-height: 20px;\"></p><p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 10px;\n  color: rgb(102, 102, 102); font-family: \'\'Open Sans\'\', sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\n  line-height: 20px;\">Herniated discs cause problems for two reasons. First, the gel-like\n  substance that leaks into the spinal canal from the nucleus pulposus can exert pressure\n  on the spinal nerves. There is also a possibility that this gel-like material causes\n  a chemical irritation of the nerve roots. The pressure, combined with the irritation,\n  can cause the nerve roots to not function correctly. The result is pain, and/or\n  numbness and weakness in the portion of the body served by the affected nerve.&nbsp;</p><div\n  class=\"author\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; font-style: italic; font-size: 10px;\n  float: right; margin-right: 10px; margin-top: -10px; color: rgb(102, 102, 102);\n  font-family: \'\'Open Sans\'\', sans-serif;\"></div><div class=\"row\" style=\"box-sizing:\n  border-box; margin-left: -15px; margin-right: -15px; color: rgb(102, 102, 102);\n  font-family: \'\'Open Sans\'\', sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px;\"></div><h2\n  style=\"box-sizing: border-box; font-family: \'\'Open Sans\'\', sans-serif; font-weight:\n  500; line-height: 1.1; color: rgb(153, 0, 102); margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom:\n  10px;\">Symptoms</h2><p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 10px; color:\n  rgb(102, 102, 102); font-family: \'\'Open Sans\'\', sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height:\n  20px;\">Some people with a true herniated disc do not experience any pain.

This will take the pressure and irritation off the spine. He also\n  removes as much of the material he can that is still inside the disc to prevent\n  it from leaking out (herniating) again. &nbsp;</p><p style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\n  margin-bottom: 10px; color: rgb(102, 102, 102); font-family: \'\'Open Sans\'\', sans-serif;\n  font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px;\">When the doctor is finished with the procedure,\n  the muscles are replaced into position, and the skin incision is closed with metal\n  staples or sutures.&nbsp;</p><h4 style=\"box-sizing: border-box; font-family: Roboto,\n  sans-serif; font-weight: 300; line-height: 1.1; color: rgb(153, 0, 102); margin-bottom:\n  0px; font-size: 16px; text-transform: uppercase;\">MICRO-DISCECTOMY</h4><p style=\"box-sizing:\n  border-box; margin-bottom: 10px; color: rgb(102, 102, 102); font-family: \'\'Open\n  Sans\'\', sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px;\">This procedure is basically\n  the same as the traditional laminotomy and discectomy; however, the incision is\n  much smaller. This means there is less injury to the unaffected parts of your spine\n  during the procedure and recovery may occur more rapidly.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"box-sizing:\n  border-box; margin-bottom: 10px; color: rgb(102, 102, 102); font-family: \'\'Open\n  Sans\'\', sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px;\">A very small incision is\n  made just over the herniated disc, and the muscles are moved aside as in the traditional\n  procedure.

Other\n  special surgical instruments are also inserted through these small incisions, and\n  the surgeon views the TV screen and guides the instruments to remove the disc material.\n  &nbsp;</p><p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 10px; color: rgb(102,\n  102, 102); font-family: \'\'Open Sans\'\', sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height:\n  20px;\">This procedure is not yet being widely used and is still evolving. It is\n  beneficial in that the incisions required are very small (1/4 inch), so do even\n  less damage to tissues around the spine than the micro-discectomy.

C<i style=\"box-sizing:\n  border-box;\">auda equina syndrome</i>&nbsp; is probably the most serious complication\n  that can occur as a result of a herniated disc. This syndrome results when a large\n  portion of disc material ruptures into the spinal canal in the area where the nerves\n  travel which control bowel and bladder function. &nbsp;Permanent damage to these\n  nerves can result from pressure. If this happens, you may become incontinent (lose\n  control) of bowel and bladder function. This is a rare, but serious condition. If\n  your physician suspects this is happening, he will recommend immediate surgery to\n  get the pressure off the nerves. &nbsp;</p><h4 style=\"box-sizing: border-box; font-family:\n  Roboto, sans-serif; font-weight: 300; line-height: 1.1; color: rgb(153, 0, 102);\n  margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 16px; text-transform: uppercase;\">DURING SURGERY</h4><p\n  style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 10px; color: rgb(102, 102, 102); font-family:\n  \'\'Open Sans\'\', sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px;\">During any type\n  of surgical procedure there is always the risk of complication due to anesthesia.\n  Possible complications during an operation for a herniated disc include:&nbsp;</p><p\n  style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 10px; color: rgb(102, 102, 102); font-family:\n  \'\'Open Sans\'\', sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px;\"><b style=\"box-sizing:\n  border-box;\">Nerve injury:&nbsp;</b>Removal of herniated disc material involves\n  working near the spinal nerves.

If it goes unnoticed\n  during surgery, the tear may not heal and it can leak spinal fluid. Leakage of spinal\n  fluid can result in problems such as spinal headaches and the risk of infection\n  in the spinal fluid, called&nbsp;<i style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\">spinal meningitis.&nbsp;</i>If\n  the leak does not heal and seal itself on its own fairly soon after surgery, the\n  tear in the dura may have to be surgically repaired.

Infection can develop around the nerves\n  in the spinal canal, inside the affected disc or in the incision made in the skin.\n  &nbsp;If infection involves only the incision in your skin, the only treatment needed\n  may be antibiotics. If the infection develops in the disc area or in the spinal\n  canal, you may need further surgery to drain the infection in addition to antibiotics.\n  &nbsp;</p><p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 10px; color: rgb(102,\n  102, 102); font-family: \'\'Open Sans\'\', sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height:\n  20px;\"><b style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\">Re-herniation:</b>&nbsp;There is about\n  a 10-15% chance that the same disc that was operated on will herniate again.

It\n  is the main path of communication between the body and the brain. The spinal cord\n  is long cord that starts at the base of the brain and extends down. The vertebrae,\n  or back bones, are involved in many spine diseases. They provide protection for\n  the spinal cord. Discs between the vertebrae cushion the spine. They are made of\n  cartilage and they can also be affected by spine diseases.</p>\\r\\n  <p>\\r\\n    Spine\n  diseases can affect any section of the spine, the cervical (neck), the middle or\n  chest (thoracic), the lower back (lumbar) or the pelvic region (sacral). In medical\n  terminology, each of these sections are referred to by their first letter: C, T,\n  L and S.\\r\\n  </p>\\r\\n\\r\\n</div>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<div id=\\\"symptoms\\\">\\r\\n  <div class=\\\"heading-block\\\">\\r\\n\n  \\   <h2>Causes of Spine Diseases</h2>\\r\\n  </div>\\r\\n  <p>Some spine diseases start\n  outside the spinal canal. These include things like many types of infections and\n  injuries. Compression also often originates outside the canal and results in spine\n  disease. Pressure on the spinal cord or nerves can be caused by bone, blood accumulation,\n  an abscess, a mass or tumor, or a herniated disc.  </p>\\r\\n\\r\\n  <p>Less often,\n  spine diseases start in the spinal canal itself. These include some types of infection,\n  multiple sclerosis, blockages in the blood flow, inflammation, tumors, bleeding\n  and vitamin and mineral deficiencies. </p>\\r\\n</div>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<div id=\\\"diagnostic\\\">\\r\\n\n  \\ <div class=\\\"heading-block\\\">\\r\\n    <h2>Symptoms</h2>\\r\\n  </div>\\r\\n\\r\\n  <p>Spine\n  diseases cause a variety of different symptoms depending on which part of the spine\n  is affected. The following symptoms may be noted, and their severity can range from\n  mild to severe:</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n  <div class=\\\"clear\\\">\\r\\n    <ul>\\r\\n      <li>Pain</li>\\r\\n\n  \\     <li>Muscle weakness</li>\\r\\n      <li>Loss or change in sensation</li>\\r\\n\n  \\     <li>Paralysis</li>\\r\\n      <li>Loss of bowel and/or bladder control (incontinence)</li>\\r\\n\n  \\     <li>Sexual dysfunction</li>\\r\\n      <li>Changes in reflexes</li>\\r\\n    </ul>\\r\\n\n  \\ </div>\\r\\n  <p>\\r\\n    Physicians can determine what part of the spinal cord or\n  nerves are affected by a spine disease by identifying the functions that are affected\n  or lost. The ability to perform certain functions may be partially or totally lost.\n  Only those function that are controlled by areas of the spinal cord below the damage\n  are affected; those above are left intact.\\r\\n  </p>\\r\\n  <p>\\r\\n    In spine diseases\n  that cause paralysis or weakness, muscles that are not used often become flaccid\n  or limp. In other conditions, especially in some spine diseases that are inherited\n  and in some injuries involving the spinal cord, paralysis occurs with muscle spasms.\n  This is known as spastic paralysis. Muscle spasms occur in these spine diseases\n  because the brain cannot help control certain reflexes.\\r\\n  </p>\\r\\n</div>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<div\n  id=\\\"treatment\\\">\\r\\n  <div class=\\\"heading-block\\\">\\r\\n    <h2>Diagnostic procedures</h2>\\r\\n\n  \\ </div>\\r\\n  <p>\\r\\n    Doctors often recognize a spine disease by its characteristic\n  symptoms. Patients are given a physical examination which helps to determine a diagnosis\n  and can provide the doctor with information to determine where any damage is located.\n  Often imaging testing is recommended to help determine the cause of a spine disease.\\r\\n\n  \\ </p>\\r\\n  <p>\\r\\n    Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is one of the most accurate\n  tests available for diagnosing spine diseases. This test provides images of the\n  spinal cord and the soft tissues surrounding it, such as herniated discs, infections,\n  tumors and other structures. If an MRI is not available, the doctor may suggest\n  computed tomography (CT) with myelography to diagnose spine diseases. This is a\n  test in which a dye is injected into the area around the spinal cord, and then a\n  CT scan is completed to provide detailed images for the doctor to review.\\r\\n  </p>\\r\\n</div>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<div\n  id=\\\"treatment\\\">\\r\\n  <div class=\\\"heading-block\\\">\\r\\n    <h2>Treatment</h2>\\r\\n\n  \\ </div>\\r\\n  <p>\\r\\n    If symptoms of a spine disease suddenly appear, such as\n  sudden weakness or loss of feeling, you should see your doctor right away. Immediate\n  treatment might help prevent permanent nerve damage.\\r\\n  </p>\\r\\n  <p>\\r\\n    Patients\n  who are paralyzed due to a spine disease may need skilled care to prevent complications.\n  Complications of prolonged bed rest may include:\\r\\n  </p>\\r\\n  <div class=\\\"clear\\\">\\r\\n\n  \\   <ul>\\r\\n      <li><span>Pressure ulcers:</span> To prevent this complication\n  of spine diseases, the skin is checked often, kept dry and clean, and the patient\n  is repositioned often. Sometimes special equipment is used to keep pressure off\n  the bony parts of the body, such as the heels, elbows, hips and tailbone.</li>\\r\\n\n  \\     <li><span>Urinary complications:</span> If a patient cannot use a commode\n  or toilet, a catheter may be inserted to prevent urinary complications of spine\n  diseases. To decrease the risk of infection, catheter insertion is a sterile procedure\n  and the catheter is carefully cared for. Hydration is very important for spine disease\n  patients who have urinary catheters.</li>\\r\\n      <li><span>Pneumonia:</span> To\n  decrease the chance of pneumonia in spine disease patients, deep breathing exercises\n  may be used. The patient may also require suctioning of their secretions if they\n  are unable to cough on their own.</li>\\r\\n      <li><span>Blood clots:</span> Patients\n  who have spine diseases and can\'t move on their own are at risk for blood clots.\n  To prevent this, medications like heparin may be given.</li>\\r\\n    </ul>\\r\\n  </div>\\r\\n\n  \\ <p>\\r\\n    People who have spine diseases and have suffered extensive loss of\n  independence are often depressed and discouraged.

These are called intervertebral\n  discs. They are sometimes compared to jelly doughnuts. Each disc has a tough outer\n  ring made up of fibers, that are really a strong ligament that bind the vertebra\n  together. This outer rim is called the annulus, and it is the strongest part of\n  the disc. The center of each disc, called the nucleus pulposus, is filled with a\n  gel-like substance. This soft center is what gives the discs their ability to act\n  as shock-absorbers.</p>\\r\\n    <p>When a disc herniates, the tough outer rim is\n  damaged and the soft gel center moves out of its normal space. If the rim is damaged\n  near the spinal canal, the gel material can bulge out and press into the spinal\n  nerves or the spinal cord.</p>\\r\\n  </div>\\r\\n  <h3>Causes of Herniated Discs</h3>\\r\\n\n  \\ <p>The primary reasons discs herniate is due to normal wear and tear on the spine\n  and the process of aging. As we grow older, the discs between our vertebrae are\n  negatively affected by changes that cause them to dry out and lose some of their\n  elasticity. This is usually a slow process and the herniation develops gradually.\n  Occasionally, events  occur that cause a disc to suddenly rupture or herniate. Examples\n  of these types of events are trauma, such as falls or other injuries such as car\n  accidents. Lifting or twisting are other examples of events that can cause a disc\n  to herniate suddenly.</p>\\r\\n  \\r\\n  <p>Most cases of true herniated nucleus pulposus\n  occur in middle-aged and young adults. Children can develop herniated discs, but\n  this occurs rarely. In the elderly, degenerative changes in the spine that normally\n  occur with age make it less likely for a true herniated disc to develop.</p>\\r\\n\n  \\ <p>If too much pressure is placed suddenly on a disc, rupture can occur. One example\n  of this can be falling from a tree and landing on the buttocks. This type of fall\n  causes a significant amount of force to be placed on the spine all at once. If enough\n  force is experienced, either a vertebra can break or fracture, or a disc can rupture.\n  Bending from the waist also places extreme force on the intervertebral discs. If\n  you try to lift a heavy object while bending, the combination of these forces can\n  cause a ruptured disc.</p>\\r\\n  \\r\\n  <p>A small amount of force can also cause\n  a ruptured disc. When this occurs, it is usually due to weakening in the fibrous\n  rim of the disc (the annulus) from repeated trauma that has added up over time.\n  As the annulus becomes weaker, eventually too much force or pressure is applied\n  and it herniates due to its weakened condition. You may be lifting or bending in\n  a way that has never caused a problem before, but due to the aging process of the\n  spine, a rupture occurs.</p>\\r\\n  <p>Herniated discs cause problems for two reasons.\n  First, the gel-like substance that leaks into the spinal canal from the nucleus\n  pulposus can exert pressure on the spinal nerves. There is also a possibility that\n  this gel-like material causes a chemical irritation of the nerve roots. The pressure,\n  combined with the irritation, can cause the nerve roots to not function correctly.\n  The result is pain, and/or numbness and weakness in the portion of the body served\n  by the affected nerve.</p>\\r\\n</div>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<div id=\\\"symptoms\\\">\\r\\n  <div\n  class=\\\"heading-block\\\">\\r\\n    <h2>Symptoms</h2>\\r\\n  </div>\\r\\n  <p>Some people\n  with a true herniated disc do not experience any pain. The symptoms of the problem\n  come from the pressure that is placed on the spinal nerves and from irritation.\n  Many people who have disc herniation do have pain due to other problems with their\n  back that were present when the disc ruptured. Typical symptoms of a herniated lumbar\n  disc include:</p>\\r\\n  <ul>\\r\\n    <li>Pain that radiates into one leg or into both\n  legs</li>\\r\\n    <li>Tingling or numbness in areas of one leg or both legs</li>\\r\\n\n  \\   <li>Weakness in certain muscles of one leg or both legs</li>\\r\\n    <li>Absence\n  of reflexes in one leg or both legs</li>\\r\\n  </ul>\\r\\n  <p>The location of these\n  symptoms varies depending on which nerve or nerves have been compressed in the spinal\n  column. The location of the symptoms will help your physician determine the correct\n  diagnosis. By knowing where you are experiencing pain, your doctor will have a better\n  idea of the location of the ruptured disc.  </p>\\r\\n</div>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<div id=\\\"diagnostic\\\">\\r\\n\n  \\ <div class=\\\"heading-block\\\">\\r\\n    <h2>Diagnostic procedures</h2>\\r\\n  </div>\\r\\n\n  \\ \\r\\n  <p>If your physician suspects a herniated disc, he will obtain your medical\n  history and complete a thorough physical examination as well as neurological tests.\n  He will observe your spine while you are standing and while walking and may ask\n  you to complete other movements to assess your mobility and balance. He will examine\n  your spine for any sign of abnormality and will check your reflexes, assess sensation\n  and look for any sign of weakness. He will ask about your pain and other symptoms.</p>\\r\\n\n  \\ <p>Your physician may recommend imaging tests to help confirm the diagnosis of\n  a herniated disc. He may order tests such as X-rays, an MRI or a CT scan.</p>\\r\\n</div>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<div\n  id=\\\"treatment\\\">\\r\\n  <div class=\\\"heading-block\\\">\\r\\n    <h2>Treatment</h2>\\r\\n\n  \\ </div>\\r\\n  <div class=\\\"clear\\\">\\r\\n    <p>Not every case of a disc herniation\n  requires surgery. In fact, in most cases herniated discs do not require surgical\n  treatment. How a herniated disc is treated depends on the symptoms and whether they\n  are resolving or getting more serious. Your doctor is more likely to recommend surgery\n  if your symptoms are steadily becoming more severe. If your condition is improving,\n  he may recommend a course of treatment that involves watching and waiting to see\n  if your symptoms resolve. Many patients who experience problems because of a herniated\n  disc when it first occurs, find their symptoms completely go away over a period\n  of several weeks or a few months. </p>\\r\\n  </div>\\r\\n  <div class=\\\"clear\\\">\\r\\n\n  \\   <h3>Conservative Treatment</h3>\\r\\n    <p>If there are no signs of serious complications\n  resulting from a disc that has herniated, many times doctors will recommend conservative\n  treatment of your symptoms. Conservative treatment includes:</p>\\r\\n    <p>Observation:\n  This involves watching your condition to make sure the herniation does not lead\n  to other serious complications. If there are no indications of progressive weakness\n  or numbness, and your pain is manageable, your physician may suggest watching and\n  waiting.</p>\\r\\n    <p>Rest: If the herniated disc causes more significant pain,\n  your activity may need to be decreased, and you may need a few days away from your\n  job. After resting for several days, slowly start to increase your activity with\n  gentle tasks such as walking, and gradually increase your activity tolerance.</p>\\r\\n\n  \\   <p>Pain medications: Depending on how severe your pain is, different analgesics\n  (pain medications) can be used to help you be more comfortable. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory\n  drugs (NSAIDs) like aspirin, ibuprofen and naproxen can be purchased over-the-counter\n  and help to relieve pain and decrease the inflammation caused by the disc herniation.\n  These drugs can cause stomach irritation, so should be taken with food.  If these\n  medications are not effective, your physician may prescribe stronger medication\n  for your pain such as narcotics, muscle relaxants or other types of medications.\n  Narcotic analgesics can become addictive, and many doctors will not prescribe these\n  for more than a few weeks.</p>\\r\\n    <p>Epidural Steroid Injection (ESI): An injection\n  of a steroid medication such as prednisone directly into the affected disc area\n  to decrease the pain and inflammation is usually only suggested in cases of severe\n  pain or if surgery is quickly becoming the only other available treatment option.\n  ESI is only effective as a pain control intervention about 50% of the time.</p>\\r\\n\n  \\ </div>\\r\\n  <h3>Surgical Treatment</h3>\\r\\n  <div class=\\\"clear\\\">\\r\\n    <h4>Laminotomy\n  and Discectomy</h4>\\r\\n    <p>The most traditional surgical procedure for treating\n  a herniated disc is the laminotomy and discectomy.</p>\\r\\n    <p>In this operation,\n  an incision is made in the back directly over the disc that has herniated. The muscle\n  tissues under the skin are moved so the doctor can see the backbones. It may be\n  necessary to take X-rays during the operation to make sure the correct vertebra\n  and disc are chosen. A small incision is made in between the two vertebrae where\n  the ruptured disc is located. This incision allows the surgeon to visualize the\n  spinal canal.

Cauda equina syndrome  is probably the most serious complication\n  that can occur as a result of a herniated disc. This syndrome results when a large\n  portion of disc material ruptures into the spinal canal in the area where the nerves\n  travel which control bowel and bladder function.  Permanent damage to these nerves\n  can result from pressure. If this happens, you may become incontinent (lose control)\n  of bowel and bladder function. This is a rare, but serious condition. If your physician\n  suspects this is happening, he will recommend immediate surgery to get the pressure\n  off the nerves.  </p>\\r\\n  </div>\\r\\n  <div class=\\\"clear\\\">\\r\\n    <h4>During surgery</h4>\\r\\n\n  \\   <p>During any type of surgical procedure there is always the risk of complication\n  due to anesthesia. Possible complications during an operation for a herniated disc\n  include:</p>\\r\\n    <p>Nerve injury: Removal of herniated disc material involves\n  working near the spinal nerves. During the procedure, the nerves may be damaged\n  or injured. If this happens, you may suffer nerve damage, causing permanent weakness,\n  numbness or pain in the area the nerve travels.</p>\\r\\n    <p>Dural Tear: The spinal\n  cord and the spinal nerves are covered with a water-tight bag of tissue which is\n  called the dura mater. During surgery, a tear can occur in this covering and it\n  is not unusual for this to occur in any type of operation on the spine.  If the\n  tear is noticed during the operation, it is repaired and usually heals without further\n  complication. If it goes unnoticed during surgery, the tear may not heal and it\n  can leak spinal fluid. Leakage of spinal fluid can result in problems such as spinal\n  headaches and the risk of infection in the spinal fluid, called spinal meningitis.\n  If the leak does not heal and seal itself on its own fairly soon after surgery,\n  the tear in the dura may have to be surgically repaired. This would require a second\n  operation.</p>\\r\\n  </div>\\r\\n  <div class=\\\"clear\\\">\\r\\n    <h4>After surgery</h4>\\r\\n\n  \\   <p>Some complications do not become apparent until after surgery.

These are called\n  intervertebral discs. They are sometimes compared to jelly doughnuts. Each disc\n  has a tough outer ring made up of fibers, that are really a strong ligament that\n  bind the vertebra together. This outer rim is called the annulus, and it is the\n  strongest part of the disc. The center of each disc, called the nucleus pulposus,\n  is filled with a gel-like substance. This soft center is what gives the discs their\n  ability to act as shock-absorbers.</p>\\r\\n    <p>When a disc herniates, the tough\n  outer rim is damaged and the soft gel center moves out of its normal space. If the\n  rim is damaged near the spinal canal, the gel material can bulge out and press into\n  the spinal nerves or the spinal cord.</p>\\r\\n  </div>\\r\\n  <h3>Causes of Herniated\n  Discs</h3>\\r\\n  <p>The primary reasons discs herniate is due to normal wear and\n  tear on the spine and the process of aging. As we grow older, the discs between\n  our vertebrae are negatively affected by changes that cause them to dry out and\n  lose some of their elasticity. This is usually a slow process and the herniation\n  develops gradually. Occasionally, events  occur that cause a disc to suddenly rupture\n  or herniate. Examples of these types of events are trauma, such as falls or other\n  injuries such as car accidents. Lifting or twisting are other examples of events\n  that can cause a disc to herniate suddenly.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n  <p>Most cases of true herniated\n  nucleus pulposus occur in middle-aged and young adults. Children can develop herniated\n  discs, but this occurs rarely. In the elderly, degenerative changes in the spine\n  that normally occur with age make it less likely for a true herniated disc to develop.</p>\\r\\n\n  \\ <p>If too much pressure is placed suddenly on a disc, rupture can occur. One example\n  of this can be falling from a tree and landing on the buttocks. This type of fall\n  causes a significant amount of force to be placed on the spine all at once. If enough\n  force is experienced, either a vertebra can break or fracture, or a disc can rupture.\n  Bending from the waist also places extreme force on the intervertebral discs. If\n  you try to lift a heavy object while bending, the combination of these forces can\n  cause a ruptured disc.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n  <p>A small amount of force can also cause a\n  ruptured disc. When this occurs, it is usually due to weakening in the fibrous rim\n  of the disc (the annulus) from repeated trauma that has added up over time. As the\n  annulus becomes weaker, eventually too much force or pressure is applied and it\n  herniates due to its weakened condition. You may be lifting or bending in a way\n  that has never caused a problem before, but due to the aging process of the spine,\n  a rupture occurs.</p>\\r\\n  <p>Herniated discs cause problems for two reasons. First,\n  the gel-like substance that leaks into the spinal canal from the nucleus pulposus\n  can exert pressure on the spinal nerves. There is also a possibility that this gel-like\n  material causes a chemical irritation of the nerve roots. The pressure, combined\n  with the irritation, can cause the nerve roots to not function correctly. The result\n  is pain, and/or numbness and weakness in the portion of the body served by the affected\n  nerve.</p>\\r\\n</div>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<div id=\\\"symptoms\\\">\\r\\n  <div class=\\\"heading-block\\\">\\r\\n\n  \\   <h2>Symptoms</h2>\\r\\n  </div>\\r\\n  <p>Some people with a true herniated disc\n  do not experience any pain. The symptoms of the problem come from the pressure that\n  is placed on the spinal nerves and from irritation. Many people who have disc herniation\n  do have pain due to other problems with their back that were present when the disc\n  ruptured. Typical symptoms of a herniated lumbar disc include:</p>\\r\\n  <ul>\\r\\n\n  \\   <li>Pain that radiates into one leg or into both legs</li>\\r\\n    <li>Tingling\n  or numbness in areas of one leg or both legs</li>\\r\\n    <li>Weakness in certain\n  muscles of one leg or both legs</li>\\r\\n    <li>Absence of reflexes in one leg or\n  both legs</li>\\r\\n  </ul>\\r\\n  <p>The location of these symptoms varies depending\n  on which nerve or nerves have been compressed in the spinal column. The location\n  of the symptoms will help your physician determine the correct diagnosis. By knowing\n  where you are experiencing pain, your doctor will have a better idea of the location\n  of the ruptured disc.  </p>\\r\\n</div>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<div id=\\\"diagnostic\\\">\\r\\n  <div\n  class=\\\"heading-block\\\">\\r\\n    <h2>Diagnostic procedures</h2>\\r\\n  </div>\\r\\n\\r\\n\n  \\ <p>If your physician suspects a herniated disc, he will obtain your medical history\n  and complete a thorough physical examination as well as neurological tests. He will\n  observe your spine while you are standing and while walking and may ask you to complete\n  other movements to assess your mobility and balance. He will examine your spine\n  for any sign of abnormality and will check your reflexes, assess sensation and look\n  for any sign of weakness. He will ask about your pain and other symptoms.</p>\\r\\n\n  \\ <p>Your physician may recommend imaging tests to help confirm the diagnosis of\n  a herniated disc. He may order tests such as X-rays, an MRI or a CT scan.</p>\\r\\n</div>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<div\n  id=\\\"treatment\\\">\\r\\n  <div class=\\\"heading-block\\\">\\r\\n    <h2>Treatment</h2>\\r\\n\n  \\ </div>\\r\\n  <div class=\\\"clear\\\">\\r\\n    <p>Not every case of a disc herniation\n  requires surgery. In fact, in most cases herniated discs do not require surgical\n  treatment. How a herniated disc is treated depends on the symptoms and whether they\n  are resolving or getting more serious. Your doctor is more likely to recommend surgery\n  if your symptoms are steadily becoming more severe. If your condition is improving,\n  he may recommend a course of treatment that involves watching and waiting to see\n  if your symptoms resolve. Many patients who experience problems because of a herniated\n  disc when it first occurs, find their symptoms completely go away over a period\n  of several weeks or a few months. </p>\\r\\n  </div>\\r\\n  <div class=\\\"clear\\\">\\r\\n\n  \\   <h3>Conservative Treatment</h3>\\r\\n    <p>If there are no signs of serious complications\n  resulting from a disc that has herniated, many times doctors will recommend conservative\n  treatment of your symptoms. Conservative treatment includes:</p>\\r\\n    <p>Observation:\n  This involves watching your condition to make sure the herniation does not lead\n  to other serious complications. If there are no indications of progressive weakness\n  or numbness, and your pain is manageable, your physician may suggest watching and\n  waiting.</p>\\r\\n    <p>Rest: If the herniated disc causes more significant pain,\n  your activity may need to be decreased, and you may need a few days away from your\n  job. After resting for several days, slowly start to increase your activity with\n  gentle tasks such as walking, and gradually increase your activity tolerance.</p>\\r\\n\n  \\   <p>Pain medications: Depending on how severe your pain is, different analgesics\n  (pain medications) can be used to help you be more comfortable. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory\n  drugs (NSAIDs) like aspirin, ibuprofen and naproxen can be purchased over-the-counter\n  and help to relieve pain and decrease the inflammation caused by the disc herniation.\n  These drugs can cause stomach irritation, so should be taken with food.  If these\n  medications are not effective, your physician may prescribe stronger medication\n  for your pain such as narcotics, muscle relaxants or other types of medications.\n  Narcotic analgesics can become addictive, and many doctors will not prescribe these\n  for more than a few weeks.</p>\\r\\n    <p>Epidural Steroid Injection (ESI): An injection\n  of a steroid medication such as prednisone directly into the affected disc area\n  to decrease the pain and inflammation is usually only suggested in cases of severe\n  pain or if surgery is quickly becoming the only other available treatment option.\n  ESI is only effective as a pain control intervention about 50% of the time.</p>\\r\\n\n  \\ </div>\\r\\n  <h3>Surgical Treatment</h3>\\r\\n  <div class=\\\"clear\\\">\\r\\n    <h4>Laminotomy\n  and Discectomy</h4>\\r\\n    <p>The most traditional surgical procedure for treating\n  a herniated disc is the laminotomy and discectomy.</p>\\r\\n    <p>In this operation,\n  an incision is made in the back directly over the disc that has herniated. The muscle\n  tissues under the skin are moved so the doctor can see the backbones. It may be\n  necessary to take X-rays during the operation to make sure the correct vertebra\n  and disc are chosen. A small incision is made in between the two vertebrae where\n  the ruptured disc is located. This incision allows the surgeon to visualize the\n  spinal canal. A small portion of the vertebra (the lamina) usually needs to be removed\n  to make access to the spinal canal possible.</p>\\r\\n    <p>The surgeon then finds\n  the gel-like disc material which has ruptured from the disc and removes it from\n  the spinal canal.

People use the terms \\\"slipped disc\\\" and \\\"ruptured disc\\\"\n  very frequently and it\'s often assumed that every person who has pain in their back\n  has a ruptured or herniated disc. The truth is, a true herniated nucleus pulposus,\n  which is the medical term for a ruptured disc, is not a very common medical problem.\n  In fact, most disorders that cause back pain are due to something other than a herniated\n  disc.</p>\\r\\n  <p>\\r\\n    In general practice clinics, the overall incidence of\n  true herniated nucleus pulposus in patients who seek medical care due to new symptoms\n  of lower back pain is less than 2%.\\r\\n  </p>\\r\\n</div>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<div>\\r\\n  <div\n  class=\\\"heading-block\\\">\\r\\n    <h2>Reasons</h2>\\r\\n  </div>\\r\\n  <div class=\\\"clear\\\">\\r\\n\n  \\   <h3>Anatomy</h3>\\r\\n\\r\\n    <p>To better understand what happens when a disc\n  ruptures or herniates, it\'s helpful to know a little about the anatomy of the vertebrae\n  themselves and the different parts of the body that make up the spinal column.</p>\\r\\n\n  \\   <p>In between each of your vertebrae is a cushion that acts like a shock-absorber.\n  These are called intervertebral discs. They are sometimes compared to jelly doughnuts.\n  Each disc has a tough outer ring made up of fibers, that are really a strong ligament\n  that bind the vertebra together. This outer rim is called the annulus, and it is\n  the strongest part of the disc. The center of each disc, called the nucleus pulposus,\n  is filled with a gel-like substance. This soft center is what gives the discs their\n  ability to act as shock-absorbers.</p>\\r\\n    <p>When a disc herniates, the tough\n  outer rim is damaged and the soft gel center moves out of its normal space. If the\n  rim is damaged near the spinal canal, the gel material can bulge out and press into\n  the spinal nerves or the spinal cord.</p>\\r\\n  </div>\\r\\n  <h3>Causes of Herniated\n  Discs</h3>\\r\\n  <p>The primary reasons discs herniate is due to normal wear and\n  tear on the spine and the process of aging. As we grow older, the discs between\n  our vertebrae are negatively affected by changes that cause them to dry out and\n  lose some of their elasticity. This is usually a slow process and the herniation\n  develops gradually. Occasionally, events  occur that cause a disc to suddenly rupture\n  or herniate. Examples of these types of events are trauma, such as falls or other\n  injuries such as car accidents. Lifting or twisting are other examples of events\n  that can cause a disc to herniate suddenly.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n  <p>Most cases of true herniated\n  nucleus pulposus occur in middle-aged and young adults. Children can develop herniated\n  discs, but this occurs rarely. In the elderly, degenerative changes in the spine\n  that normally occur with age make it less likely for a true herniated disc to develop.</p>\\r\\n\n  \\ <p>If too much pressure is placed suddenly on a disc, rupture can occur. One example\n  of this can be falling from a tree and landing on the buttocks. This type of fall\n  causes a significant amount of force to be placed on the spine all at once. If enough\n  force is experienced, either a vertebra can break or fracture, or a disc can rupture.\n  Bending from the waist also places extreme force on the intervertebral discs. If\n  you try to lift a heavy object while bending, the combination of these forces can\n  cause a ruptured disc.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n  <p>A small amount of force can also cause a\n  ruptured disc. When this occurs, it is usually due to weakening in the fibrous rim\n  of the disc (the annulus) from repeated trauma that has added up over time. As the\n  annulus becomes weaker, eventually too much force or pressure is applied and it\n  herniates due to its weakened condition. You may be lifting or bending in a way\n  that has never caused a problem before, but due to the aging process of the spine,\n  a rupture occurs.</p>\\r\\n  <p>Herniated discs cause problems for two reasons. First,\n  the gel-like substance that leaks into the spinal canal from the nucleus pulposus\n  can exert pressure on the spinal nerves. There is also a possibility that this gel-like\n  material causes a chemical irritation of the nerve roots. The pressure, combined\n  with the irritation, can cause the nerve roots to not function correctly. The result\n  is pain, and/or numbness and weakness in the portion of the body served by the affected\n  nerve.</p>\\r\\n</div>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<div id=\\\"symptoms\\\">\\r\\n  <div class=\\\"heading-block\\\">\\r\\n\n  \\   <h2>Symptoms</h2>\\r\\n  </div>\\r\\n  <p>Some people with a true herniated disc\n  do not experience any pain. The symptoms of the problem come from the pressure that\n  is placed on the spinal nerves and from irritation. Many people who have disc herniation\n  do have pain due to other problems with their back that were present when the disc\n  ruptured. Typical symptoms of a herniated lumbar disc include:</p>\\r\\n  <ul>\\r\\n\n  \\   <li>Pain that radiates into one leg or into both legs</li>\\r\\n    <li>Tingling\n  or numbness in areas of one leg or both legs</li>\\r\\n    <li>Weakness in certain\n  muscles of one leg or both legs</li>\\r\\n    <li>Absence of reflexes in one leg or\n  both legs</li>\\r\\n  </ul>\\r\\n  <p>The location of these symptoms varies depending\n  on which nerve or nerves have been compressed in the spinal column. The location\n  of the symptoms will help your physician determine the correct diagnosis. By knowing\n  where you are experiencing pain, your doctor will have a better idea of the location\n  of the ruptured disc.  </p>\\r\\n</div>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<div id=\\\"diagnostic\\\">\\r\\n  <div\n  class=\\\"heading-block\\\">\\r\\n    <h2>Diagnostic procedures</h2>\\r\\n  </div>\\r\\n\\r\\n\n  \\ <p>If your physician suspects a herniated disc, he will obtain your medical history\n  and complete a thorough physical examination as well as neurological tests. He will\n  observe your spine while you are standing and while walking and may ask you to complete\n  other movements to assess your mobility and balance. He will examine your spine\n  for any sign of abnormality and will check your reflexes, assess sensation and look\n  for any sign of weakness. He will ask about your pain and other symptoms.</p>\\r\\n\n  \\ <p>Your physician may recommend imaging tests to help confirm the diagnosis of\n  a herniated disc. He may order tests such as X-rays, an MRI or a CT scan.</p>\\r\\n</div>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<div\n  id=\\\"treatment\\\">\\r\\n  <div class=\\\"heading-block\\\">\\r\\n    <h2>Treatment</h2>\\r\\n\n  \\ </div>\\r\\n  <div class=\\\"clear\\\">\\r\\n    <p>Not every case of a disc herniation\n  requires surgery. In fact, in most cases herniated discs do not require surgical\n  treatment. How a herniated disc is treated depends on the symptoms and whether they\n  are resolving or getting more serious. Your doctor is more likely to recommend surgery\n  if your symptoms are steadily becoming more severe. If your condition is improving,\n  he may recommend a course of treatment that involves watching and waiting to see\n  if your symptoms resolve. Many patients who experience problems because of a herniated\n  disc when it first occurs, find their symptoms completely go away over a period\n  of several weeks or a few months. </p>\\r\\n  </div>\\r\\n  <div class=\\\"clear\\\">\\r\\n\n  \\   <h3>Conservative Treatment</h3>\\r\\n    <p>If there are no signs of serious complications\n  resulting from a disc that has herniated, many times doctors will recommend conservative\n  treatment of your symptoms. Conservative treatment includes:</p>\\r\\n    <p>Observation:\n  This involves watching your condition to make sure the herniation does not lead\n  to other serious complications. If there are no indications of progressive weakness\n  or numbness, and your pain is manageable, your physician may suggest watching and\n  waiting.</p>\\r\\n    <p>Rest: If the herniated disc causes more significant pain,\n  your activity may need to be decreased, and you may need a few days away from your\n  job. After resting for several days, slowly start to increase your activity with\n  gentle tasks such as walking, and gradually increase your activity tolerance.</p>\\r\\n\n  \\   <p>Pain medications: Depending on how severe your pain is, different analgesics\n  (pain medications) can be used to help you be more comfortable. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory\n  drugs (NSAIDs) like aspirin, ibuprofen and naproxen can be purchased over-the-counter\n  and help to relieve pain and decrease the inflammation caused by the disc herniation.\n  These drugs can cause stomach irritation, so should be taken with food.  If these\n  medications are not effective, your physician may prescribe stronger medication\n  for your pain such as narcotics, muscle relaxants or other types of medications.\n  Narcotic analgesics can become addictive, and many doctors will not prescribe these\n  for more than a few weeks.</p>\\r\\n    <p>Epidural Steroid Injection (ESI): An injection\n  of a steroid medication such as prednisone directly into the affected disc area\n  to decrease the pain and inflammation is usually only suggested in cases of severe\n  pain or if surgery is quickly becoming the only other available treatment option.\n  ESI is only effective as a pain control intervention about 50% of the time.</p>\\r\\n\n  \\ </div>\\r\\n  <h3>Surgical Treatment</h3>\\r\\n  <div class=\\\"clear\\\">\\r\\n    <h4>Laminotomy\n  and Discectomy</h4>\\r\\n    <p>The most traditional surgical procedure for treating\n  a herniated disc is the laminotomy and discectomy.</p>\\r\\n    <p>In this operation,\n  an incision is made in the back directly over the disc that has herniated. The muscle\n  tissues under the skin are moved so the doctor can see the backbones. It may be\n  necessary to take X-rays during the operation to make sure the correct vertebra\n  and disc are chosen. A small incision is made in between the two vertebrae where\n  the ruptured disc is located. This incision allows the surgeon to visualize the\n  spinal canal. A small portion of the vertebra (the lamina) usually needs to be removed\n  to make access to the spinal canal possible.</p>\\r\\n    <p>The surgeon then finds\n  the gel-like disc material which has ruptured from the disc and removes it from\n  the spinal canal. This will take the pressure and irritation off the spine. He also\n  removes as much of the material he can that is still inside the disc to prevent\n  it from leaking out (herniating) again.</p>\\r\\n    <p>When the doctor is finished\n  with the procedure, the muscles are replaced into position, and the skin incision\n  is closed with metal staples or sutures.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n  </div>\\r\\n  <div class=\\\"clear\\\">\\r\\n\n  \\   <h4>Micro-discectomy</h4>\\r\\n    <p>This procedure is basically the same as\n  the traditional laminotomy and discectomy; however, the incision is much smaller.\n  This means there is less injury to the unaffected parts of your spine during the\n  procedure and recovery may occur more rapidly.</p>\\r\\n    <p>A very small incision\n  is made just over the herniated disc, and the muscles are moved aside as in the\n  traditional procedure. Once the vertebra is seen, an operating microscope is inserted\n  and used to complete the operation. The remainder of the procedure is completed\n  using the same approach as the traditional method.</p>\\r\\n  </div>\\r\\n  <div class=\\\"clear\\\">\\r\\n\n  \\   <h4>Endoscopic Discectomy</h4>\\r\\n    <p>In this operation, even smaller incisions\n  are needed to insert special television cameras into the spinal canal so the surgeon\n  can visualize the disc material. Other special surgical instruments are also inserted\n  through these small incisions, and the surgeon views the TV screen and guides the\n  instruments to remove the disc material.</p>\\r\\n    <p>This procedure is not yet\n  being widely used and is still evolving. It is beneficial in that the incisions\n  required are very small (1/4 inch), so do even less damage to tissues around the\n  spine than the micro-discectomy. This can mean fewer complications and faster recovery\n  times.</p>\\r\\n  </div>\\r\\n  <div class=\\\"clear\\\">\\r\\n    <h3>Complications</h3>\\r\\n\n  \\   <h4>Before surgery</h4>\\r\\n    <p>Complications from a herniated disc can occur\n  even before surgery. Cauda equina syndrome  is probably the most serious complication\n  that can occur as a result of a herniated disc. This syndrome results when a large\n  portion of disc material ruptures into the spinal canal in the area where the nerves\n  travel which control bowel and bladder function.  Permanent damage to these nerves\n  can result from pressure. If this happens, you may become incontinent (lose control)\n  of bowel and bladder function. This is a rare, but serious condition. If your physician\n  suspects this is happening, he will recommend immediate surgery to get the pressure\n  off the nerves.  </p>\\r\\n  </div>\\r\\n  <div class=\\\"clear\\\">\\r\\n    <h4>During surgery</h4>\\r\\n\n  \\   <p>During any type of surgical procedure there is always the risk of complication\n  due to anesthesia. Possible complications during an operation for a herniated disc\n  include:</p>\\r\\n    <p>Nerve injury: Removal of herniated disc material involves\n  working near the spinal nerves. During the procedure, the nerves may be damaged\n  or injured. If this happens, you may suffer nerve damage, causing permanent weakness,\n  numbness or pain in the area the nerve travels.</p>\\r\\n    <p>Dural Tear: The spinal\n  cord and the spinal nerves are covered with a water-tight bag of tissue which is\n  called the dura mater. During surgery, a tear can occur in this covering and it\n  is not unusual for this to occur in any type of operation on the spine.  If the\n  tear is noticed during the operation, it is repaired and usually heals without further\n  complication. If it goes unnoticed during surgery, the tear may not heal and it\n  can leak spinal fluid. Leakage of spinal fluid can result in problems such as spinal\n  headaches and the risk of infection in the spinal fluid, called spinal meningitis.\n  If the leak does not heal and seal itself on its own fairly soon after surgery,\n  the tear in the dura may have to be surgically repaired. This would require a second\n  operation.</p>\\r\\n  </div>\\r\\n  <div class=\\\"clear\\\">\\r\\n    <h4>After surgery</h4>\\r\\n\n  \\   <p>Some complications do not become apparent until after surgery. Some become\n  evident soon after your operation and others may take months to show up. Post-surgical\n  complications include:</p>\\r\\n    <p><span>Infection:</span>  All surgical procedures\n  carry some risk for infection and surgery on the spine is no different. Infection\n  can develop around the nerves in the spinal canal, inside the affected disc or in\n  the incision made in the skin.  If infection involves only the incision in your\n  skin, the only treatment needed may be antibiotics. If the infection develops in\n  the disc area or in the spinal canal, you may need further surgery to drain the\n  infection in addition to antibiotics.</p>\\r\\n    <p><span>Re-herniation:</span>\n  There is about a 10-15% chance that the same disc that was operated on will herniate\n  again. This usually occurs within the first six weeks following your surgery, but\n  it may happen anytime. If this occurs, you may need another operation.</p>\\r\\n    <p><span>Persistent\n  pain:</span> Surgery does not always eliminate pain. There are many reasons people\n  continue to have pain despite back surgery. These reasons include:</p>\\r\\n    <ul>\\r\\n\n  \\     <li>If the nerves have been damaged by pressure caused from the herniated\n  disc, complete recovery may not be possible.</li>\\r\\n      <li>Scar tissue may form\n  around the nerves following surgery. This puts pressure on the nerves and causes\n  pain similar to the pain caused by the herniated disc.</li>\\r\\n      <li>The pain\n  you were having prior to surgery may be from issues in addition to disc herniation\n  that were not solved by removing the herniated disc.</li>\\r\\n    </ul>\\r\\n    <p><span>Degenerative\n  disc Disease:</span>  Any time a disc is injured, the injury can lead to degeneration\n  in that portion of the spine. A disc that has been surgically altered can certainly\n  be considered as \\\"injured.\\\" This places the surrounding area of the spine at increased\n  risk for degenerative changes to occur.  The degenerative process is very slow,\n  usually taking several years to occur, but if the changes caused by degeneration\n  become severe, a second surgery may be needed.</p>\\r\\n  </div>\\r\\n  <div class=\\\"clear\\\">\\r\\n\n  \\   <h3>Rehabilitation</h3>\\r\\n\\r\\n    <p>Following your operation, your physician\n  will probably recommend physical therapy before you begin an exercise routine on\n  your own. A skilled therapist will help you choose exercises that are safe and effective\n  for you as an individual. Exercise is essential to your recovery as well as to maintaining\n  your spine health over time. It\'s the easiest and most sensible way to combat problems\n  with your back.</p>\\r\\n    <p>Research has shown that exercise, done on a regular\n  basis is linked to fewer back problems. It has many benefits for your spine health\n  including:</p>\\r\\n    <ul>\\r\\n      <li>Strengthening: It can help strengthen your\n  core muscles that help support your spine, and also can strengthen the muscles of\n  your arms and legs. Strength in your muscles reduces back strain.</li>\\r\\n      <li>Exercise\n  can reduce your risk of falling and sustaining injuries.</li>\\r\\n      <li>Stretching\n  exercises decrease the risk of painful spasms in the muscles.</li>\\r\\n      <li>Weight-bearing\n  exercise helps to prevent osteoporosis, which in turn decreases your risk of compression\n  fractures.</li>\\r\\n      <li>Aerobic exercise, the kind that increases your heart\n  rate, can help to relieve pain.
