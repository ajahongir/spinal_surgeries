    <h2>Definition</h2>
  </div>
  <p>Your backbone (spine, vertebrae) protects your spinal cord and allows you to stand and bend. A wide range of spine diseases can occur, for many different reasons. Some of these include: </p>
  <div class="clear">

    <ul>
      <li>Infections</li>
      <li>Injuries</li>
      <li>Tumors</li>
      <li>Conditions, such as scoliosis and ankylosing spondylitis</li>
      <li>Bone changes that come with aging, such as herniated discs and spinal stenosis</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <p>
    Spine diseases may be accompanied by very different symptoms, and many times these conditions also cause pain. Pain is most likely to happen when pressure or stress is placed on the spinal cord or nerves. These spine diseases can also limit movement. Treatments vary, depending on condition or disease, but sometimes include braces, splints or surgery.<p><img src="/uploads/images/pages/3/large_dollarphotoclub_29565408.jpg" style=""></p>

    <h2>Reasons</h2>
  </div>
  <div class="clear">
    <ul>
      <li>Spine diseases can be caused by damage to the spinal cord due to infection, injury or lack of blood supply</li>
      <li>In many spine diseases, the muscles are weakened or even paralyzed, sensation is decreased, lost or abnormal. Bowel and bladder function can be affected</li>
      <li>Diagnosis of spine diseases is based on symptoms, a physical exam and the results of tests, such as an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging)</li>
      <li>The underlying reason for the spine disease is corrected, if possible</li>
      <li>Rehab, such as physical therapy, is often needed to regain strength, function and mobility</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <p>Spine diseases may involve the spinal cord. It is the main path of communication between the body and the brain. The spinal cord is long cord that starts at the base of the brain and extends down. The vertebrae, or back bones, are involved in many spine diseases. They provide protection for the spinal cord. Discs between the vertebrae cushion the spine. They are made of cartilage and they can also be affected by spine diseases.</p>
  <p>
    Spine diseases can affect any section of the spine, the cervical (neck), the middle or chest (thoracic), the lower back (lumbar) or the pelvic region (sacral). In medical terminology, each of these sections are referred to by their first letter: C, T, L and S.

    <h2>Causes of Spine Diseases</h2>
  </div>
  <p>Some spine diseases start outside the spinal canal. These include things like many types of infections and injuries. Compression also often originates outside the canal and results in spine disease. Pressure on the spinal cord or nerves can be caused by bone, blood accumulation, an abscess, a mass or tumor, or a herniated disc.  </p>

  <p>Less often, spine diseases start in the spinal canal itself. These include some types of infection, multiple sclerosis, blockages in the blood flow, inflammation, tumors, bleeding and vitamin and mineral deficiencies. </p>

    <h2>Symptoms</h2>
  </div>

  <p>Spine diseases cause a variety of different symptoms depending on which part of the spine is affected. The following symptoms may be noted, and their severity can range from mild to severe:</p>

  <div class="clear">
    <ul>
      <li>Pain</li>
      <li>Muscle weakness</li>
      <li>Loss or change in sensation</li>
      <li>Paralysis</li>
      <li>Loss of bowel and/or bladder control (incontinence)</li>
      <li>Sexual dysfunction</li>
      <li>Changes in reflexes</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <p>
    Physicians can determine what part of the spinal cord or nerves are affected by a spine disease by identifying the functions that are affected or lost. The ability to perform certain functions may be partially or totally lost. Only those function that are controlled by areas of the spinal cord below the damage are affected; those above are left intact.
  </p>
  <p>
    In spine diseases that cause paralysis or weakness, muscles that are not used often become flaccid or limp. In other conditions, especially in some spine diseases that are inherited and in some injuries involving the spinal cord, paralysis occurs with muscle spasms. This is known as spastic paralysis. Muscle spasms occur in these spine diseases because the brain cannot help control certain reflexes.

    <h2>Diagnostic procedures</h2>
  </div>
  <p>
    Doctors often recognize a spine disease by its characteristic symptoms. Patients are given a physical examination which helps to determine a diagnosis and can provide the doctor with information to determine where any damage is located. Often imaging testing is recommended to help determine the cause of a spine disease.
  </p>
  <p>
    Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is one of the most accurate tests available for diagnosing spine diseases. This test provides images of the spinal cord and the soft tissues surrounding it, such as herniated discs, infections, tumors and other structures. If an MRI is not available, the doctor may suggest computed tomography (CT) with myelography to diagnose spine diseases. This is a test in which a dye is injected into the area around the spinal cord, and then a CT scan is completed to provide detailed images for the doctor to review.

    <h2>Treatment</h2>
  </div>
  <p>
    If symptoms of a spine disease suddenly appear, such as sudden weakness or loss of feeling, you should see your doctor right away. Immediate treatment might help prevent permanent nerve damage.
  </p>
  <p>
    Patients who are paralyzed due to a spine disease may need skilled care to prevent complications. Complications of prolonged bed rest may include:
  </p>
  <div class="clear">
    <ul>
      <li><span>Pressure ulcers:</span> To prevent this complication of spine diseases, the skin is checked often, kept dry and clean, and the patient is repositioned often. Sometimes special equipment is used to keep pressure off the bony parts of the body, such as the heels, elbows, hips and tailbone.</li>
      <li><span>Urinary complications:</span> If a patient cannot use a commode or toilet, a catheter may be inserted to prevent urinary complications of spine diseases. To decrease the risk of infection, catheter insertion is a sterile procedure and the catheter is carefully cared for. Hydration is very important for spine disease patients who have urinary catheters.</li>
      <li><span>Pneumonia:</span> To decrease the chance of pneumonia in spine disease patients, deep breathing exercises may be used. The patient may also require suctioning of their secretions if they are unable to cough on their own.</li>
      <li><span>Blood clots:</span> Patients who have spine diseases and can't move on their own are at risk for blood clots. To prevent this, medications like heparin may be given.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <p>
    People who have spine diseases and have suffered extensive loss of independence are often depressed and discouraged. Counseling is sometimes very helpful and can help prepare patients for rehab.

    <h2>Rehabilitation</h2>
  </div>
  <p>
    Rehab usually includes a team of nurses, therapists, a doctor, a dietitian, social worker, counselors and other professionals who work with a patient and their family to help them recover from their spine disease and regain as much independence as possible. Nurses will assist with learning how to manage physical care and concerns. Therapists work with the patient on physical strengthening and independence with tasks of daily living. Counselors and social workers can assist with issues spine disease patients face as they return to family life, work and the community.
