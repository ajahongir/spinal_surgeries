    <h2>Spine Anatomy &amp; Physiology</h2>
  </div>
  <p>
    The spinal column in the human body normally is made up of 24 vertebrae that are connected by joints and nine vertebrae in the sacrum and the coccyx or tailbone that are fused together. The spine, or the vertebral column is located in the back of the trunk or the torso. In between each pair of vertebrae, other than those that are fused, lies an intervertebral disc that separates the backbones and provides cushioning and absorbs the vibrations that occur with movement. The spinal cord is located within the protective spinal column.
  </p>
  <p>
    The vertebral column is normally consists of 33 vertebrae. This includes the 5 sacral vertebrae and the 4 bones of the coccyx (tailbone). The upper 24 vertebrae are separated into three regions, the cervical, the thoracic and the lumbar regions.

    <h3>Cervical</h3>

    <p>The cervical region of the spine is made up of the first 7 vertebrae found closest to the skull in the neck area. They are named C1 through C7 beginning closest to the skull and continuing in order away from it.</p>
  </div>

  <h3>Thoracic</h3>
  <p>There are 12 thoracic vertebrae found in the chest and rib area. They are named T1 through T12. T1 lies next to C7, separated by an intervertebral disc.</p>

  <h3>Lumbar</h3>
  <p>There are 5 lumbar vertebrae in the low back and pelvis, L1 through L5. L1 immediately follows T12 with an intervertebral disc separating the two.</p>
  <p>
    Occasionally an additional vertebra is found in an area of the spine, or a vertebra is missing in one region and the deficiency is made up in another area. Very rarely, however, is the number of cervical vertebrae altered.</p><p><img src="/uploads/images/pages/2/overal_spine.jpg"></p>
